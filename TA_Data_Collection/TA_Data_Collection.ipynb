      "They affirmed that these decisions violate and threaten not only Afghan women’s rights and freedoms, but also the overall much-needed social and economic development of the country, which will suffer greatly if half of the population is excluded from participating meaningfully; emphasised that humanitarian assistance cannot be delivered fairly or effectively if limited by discriminatory policies or practices.\n",

      "\n",
      "“We have convened this conference to dispel the deep misperceptions that exist about the rights, roles and identity of women in Islam,” he told ministers and senior officials from around the world participating in the conference being held on the sidelines of the Commission on Status of Women (CSW) at the UN headquarters in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "The foreign minister said that the caricature that dominates the perception of women in Islam and Muslim society was one painted on the ignorance of the Islamic history and roles that women had played.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This caricature is a result that the perception of our religion has largely been hijacked after 9/11 by extremists who do not represent our faith and I feel a special responsibility to counter this propaganda and perception.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It offends me as a Muslim and a Pakistani to the core of my heart that the face of Islam unfortunately in much of western public perception are the likes of Osama Bin Laden and not of the likes of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a fuller understanding, FM Bilawal said, it was essential to distinguish between Islamic principles and law, and social practices espoused by some patriarchal societies. It was a distinction that xenophobes, Islamophobes and obscurantists would not like to make because “they believe in discrimination, a first step towards tyranny”.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, “Islam forbids injustice against people, nations, women. It shuns race, colour and gender as a basis of distinction among persons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Islam treats women as human beings in their own right, not as chattel,” FM Bilawal said as the world celebrated International Women’s Day. Under Islamic law and tradition – the Sharia, he said a woman had an independent social and legal identity and enjoys civil, political, economic, and cultural rights as well as inherit, divorce, receive alimony and child custody.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Muslim women have been agents of change in their societies. Islamic history is replete with examples of illustrious women: Hazrat Khadija (RA), a women business entrepreneur; Hazrat Ayesha (RA), a scholar and preacher; Hazrat Zainab Bint Ali (RA), a brave fighter, participant and survivor of the battle of Karbala; Hazrat Rabia Basri, a Sufi mystic; Shuhdah al-Baghdadiyyah, a scholar and calligrapher; Fatima al-Samarqandi, a scholar and jurist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even today, he said, millions of Muslim women continued to dominate multiple fields – politics, education, health, science, commerce- in Muslim societies, citing Megawati Sukarnoputri, the first Muslim female President (of Indonesia), Najla Bouden, Prime Minister of Tunisia; Tansu Çiller, Prime Minister of Turkiye, Elsafty, a computer scientist at the University of Cambridge; Anousheh Ansari, first Muslim space explorer and astronaut, and Malala Yousufzai, the youngest Muslim girl to have won the Nobel Prize.\n",

      "\n",
      "“In the context of the progressive and enlightened message of Islam, it is but natural for Pakistan – and other OIC countries – to express our deep disappointment at the restrictions imposed on the human rights of women and girls, especially their right to education and work, in Afghanistan,” the foreign minister said, emphasising those restrictions were contrary to the injunctions of Islam.\n",

      "“Nor can we ignore the plight of the millions of Muslim women living in non-Muslim countries who face obstacles in the enjoyment of their rights, including their right to freedom of religion,” he said, adding that the hijab ban in some countries was a denial of their freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We must counter the denial of religious and cultural rights to Muslim women in non-Muslim societies and negative stereotyping and discrimination against Muslim women,” FM Bilawal said, as they were manifestations of Islamophobia.\n",

      "The Ministry of Finance wanted to borrow at least one-tenth of its financing needs through direct negotiations with commercial banks.

      "Steel sector braces for shortage of raw material\n",
      "Pakistan’s long steel sector is bracing itself for a potential shortage of raw material in anticipation of steel scrap prices hitting a record high. A move that poses a significant threat to the industry’s operations and profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Letters of Credit (LCs) not being opened, domestic scrap shortage is compounding and is hitting manufacturers drastically, said Syed Wajid Bukhari, Secretary General of the Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers (PALSP) in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The crisis-hit steel industry is facing an acute shortage of raw material scrap, with the situation going from bad to worse every day. The local price of scrap has jumped from Rs120,000 to Rs200,000 per tonne in just three weeks, forcing many mills to shut down. Only 30% of the mills are operating and that too at very low utilisation rates,” lamented Wajid, adding that, “Record scrap prices threaten to paralyse the steel industry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "JS Global Steel Sector Analyst Waqas Ghani Kukaswadia attributed the long steel sector’s crisis to the sharp depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, rising inflation and impediments on the import of raw material due to LC restrictions. “In addition, the price of steel scrap, that accounts for over 60% of a rebar manufacturer’s cost, has also increased by around 27% from its most recent low of $339 per tonne in November 2022,” said Kukaswadia, adding that, “In an effort to pass on the rising costs, steel rebar producers have been raising prices by roughly Rs85,000 per tonne, up 38% since the beginning of the year.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the delayed production caused by the scarcity of imported raw material, he said, “Some steel companies have also suffered losses on account of demurrages paid for containers withheld at ports.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rebar manufacturers are being held hostage by domestic scrap dealers or Kabaris. Along with domestic scrap prices, rebar prices are likely to cross over Rs325,000 per tonne,” said the PALSP secretary general.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kabaris are dominating the market and holding mills hostage with their pricing,” said Bukhari, adding that, “The shortage is particularly acute in the case of scrap imports, a critical component for the steel industry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second quarter of the current fiscal year, scrap imports stood at 616,000 metric tonnes, a decline of 50% from the same period last year when 1,235,000 metric tonnes were imported; the largest drop in scrap imports in the last two decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Industry experts have warned that the crisis will have a far-reaching impact, with 42 allied industries expected to be adversely impacted and 7.5 million jobs at risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The steel industry is the backbone of the economy, and if we do not take action now, the consequences will be dire,” warned Bukhari.\n",

      "Rs7.2tr added to debt from Jul-Jan\n",
      "The coalition government has managed to add a net Rs7.2 trillion to the debt pile in only the first seven months of this fiscal year – an average of Rs34 billion per day. The accumulation of debt is now nearly three times more than the gap between federal income and expenditures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Tuesday released the central government’s debt bulletin until January 2023, showing the adverse impact of the steep currency devaluation on debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal government’s debt increased to nearly Rs55 trillion as of end-January – a surge of Rs7.2 trillion from the period between July 2022 to January 2023, according to the SBP statement. The debt burden increased at a pace of 15% during this period, which for a country like Pakistan is entirely unsustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The development came amidst disclosure that the net federal income dropped by Rs200 billion to Rs400 billion less than the total interest expenses. For the current fiscal year, the net federal income is estimated at Rs5 trillion while the cabinet last month approved a Rs5.2 trillion revised interest expenses bill for fiscal year 2022-23, ending in June.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first time that the net income is even less than the cost of debt servicing. Now, the entire defence budget and civilian government expenses are being covered through fresh loans. The net income is calculated after payment of provincial shares in the federal taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government has, on average, added Rs34 billion per day to the debt burden during this period. The increase, however, took place more due to currency devaluation than budget deficit financing.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Finance Ministry, the federal budget deficit remained at Rs1.8 trillion in the first six months of the current fiscal year. There was no phenomenal increase in the deficit in January that widened at a normal average, according to the sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first debt bulletin the central bank has released since the federal government allowed the rupee to depreciate on January 26th. The government took the decision to allow market forces to determine the value of the rupee to convince the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to release dates for their staff level visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The average exchange rate on the last day of fiscal year 2022 was Rs204.4 that depreciated by 31% in just seven months and closed at Rs267.9 to a dollar on January 31st, according to the central bank. The rupee is currently traded around Rs278 to a dollar.\n",
      "\n",
      "This had a huge impact on the government’s external debt calculations, increasing at an alarming pace of 23.5% to Rs20.7 trillion within seven months. There was a net increase of Rs3.9 trillion in external debt, mainly because of currency depreciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last fiscal year, there was an increase of Rs9.4 trillion in public debt, a sum of Rs3.8 trillion, or 40.3%, caused by currency devaluation, according to the Debt Policy Statement released by the Ministry of Finance last month. The rupee depreciated by around 30% against the dollar during the last fiscal year, which increased external public debt when reported in Pakistani rupee terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to a combination of factors, including currency devaluation, public debt has remained above the statutory limit defined under the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act of 2005. The Finance Ministry’s report from last month showed that debt burden was higher by Rs10.4 trillion than the legally allowed limit, making it unsustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 58% limit, considered sustainable, was breached by 15.5% of the GDP or Rs10.4 trillion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The currency risks of public debt have increased phenomenally, as the share of external debt in the total public debt is on the rise despite foreign financing lines drying up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SBP’s debt bulletin showed that domestic debt increased from Rs31 trillion in June last year to Rs34.3 trillion the end of January 2023. There was an increase of Rs3.2 trillion or 10.7% in domestic debt during the current fiscal year. While domestic debt is mostly raised for budget deficit financing, its quantum is still more than the total federal budget deficit.\n",

      "This Women’s Day, here’s honouring 6 female actors\n",
      "These stars are the face of many powerful characters on television\n",
      "\n",
      "Today is International Women's Day—a day to admire and acknowledge all the remarkable women around us. While we celebrate all the inspiring female figures in our lives, let's also take a look at the powerful women we see onscreen and applaud the actors who have portrayed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Sarwat Gilani's gutsy portrayal of Sara in Churails to Alina Khan’s gut-wrenching depiction of Biba in Joyland, showbiz is full of talented female actors who put their heart and soul into their craft and actively uptake roles that are empowering, thoughtful and hold substance.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Hadiqa Kiani\n",
      "\n",
      "Kiani is the jack of all trades; from being a popular singer, philanthropist, to a budding actor, she has achieved so much in her life. Recently, Kiani also announced that her charity drive, Vaseela-e-Raah, has completed the construction of 100 houses in Balochistan, including plans to construct a primary school, grocery store, and maternity centre for flood victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Kiani's efforts to positively influence and empower people around her don't stop here. The singer-cum-actor has time and again opted for unconventional roles on TV since making her acting debut. Pinjra, in which Kiani plays the mother, received positive reviews due to its focus on problematic parenting techniques and children. Her latest offering, Dobara, also depicts the story of a widow, Mehrunisa, who gets a second chance at life after the death of her controlling husband, Hidayatullah.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Sarwat Gilani\n",
      "\n",
      "By now, the Qatil Haseenaon Ke Naam star has carved an image in the showbiz for the unique projects she chooses to work on. The much-acclaimed film Joyland is just a pebble in an ocean. From Churails to Meri Zaat Zarra-e-Benishan and Mere Dard Ko Zuban Milay, Gilani always had the knack for playing characters that either inspire other women or teach a hard-hitting lesson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, Gilani has also starred in Noor, a Pakistani short film that confronts the stigma surrounding weak eyesight and wearing prescription glasses. The Umer Adil directorial has already won the Best Health Film award in the January online edition of the Cannes World Film Festival and also proves Gilani's determination to address important issues of society onscreen.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Alina Khan\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Alina Khan has only played lead roles in the short film Darling in 2019 and the feature film Joyland in 2022, her work has generated an unabated thunder across the nation and beyond. Being the first transwoman to work in an Oscar-shortlisted film that has won several international accolades is not only an inspiration but also a milestone for all trans actors in Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Malala Yousafzai, Joyland's executive producer, said in a recent interview with Sky News, \"Everyone deserves their story to be told; what's more important is that it is told by them. A trans person should be given the same rights as anyone else. What's unfortunate is that we don't want people to talk about issues. We don't want their stories to make it to the screen. I hope we challenge that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Saba Qamar\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar to Gilani, the Kamli actor has also established herself as someone who opts for noteworthy roles. From being featured in Hindi Medium with late Indian actor Irrfan Khan to essaying Qandeel Baloch in Baaghi, the versatile star has always worked in powerful and thought-provoking storylines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Qamar's most recent offering, Sar-e-Rah is also being lauded by viewers for its refreshing take on gender roles. The leading character, Rania, breaks many gender stereotypes by becoming a taxi driver to earn a living. The TV show also portrays caring, open-minded men which is a rare sight to see with all the angry and abusive men on television.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Samina Peerzada\n",
      "\n",
      "If we are making a list of inspiring performers, it also has to include Samina Peerzada! The veteran actor is known as a powerful matriarch on television and has worked on various empowering projects in her decades-long career. From her ground-breaking portrayal of a loving and supportive mother-in-law in Rehaai, to her leading role in Durr-e-Shahwar, the actor has broken many harmful stereotypes.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Yumna Zaidi\n",
      "\n",
      "While it's the norm to only see dolled-up women on television, Yumna Zaidi shatters the standards and expectations of beauty with her role in Bakhtawar. Her character is a young, headstrong girl who changes her appearance to escape hardships in life and earn money.\n",
      "\n",
      "The starlet has wowed drama viewers this year with her incredible acting prowess and has gained many fans for portraying various characters in social and romantic dramas. To name a few, Sinf-e-Aahan, Dil Na Umeed Tou Nahin and Parizaad remain one of her most memorable performances onscreen, which also include strong-willed female characters.\n",

      "By now it seems T-Series is living up to its reputation. The renowned Indian record label has once again come under scrutiny for allegedly ripping off another Pakistani song. This time, it’s Taher Shah’s baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s right! Eye to Eye, the song that became a meme back home and turned Shah into a laughing stock – while most listeners eventually grew to appreciate his uniqueness – has apparently inspired Bhushan Kumar, Tulsi Kumar and Jubin Nautiyal’s latest, Mast Aankhein.\n",
      "\n",
      "The track released on February 24 shares uncanny melodic resemblance to Shah’s Eye to Eye. So much so, that Indian composer Mayur Jumani was even taken aback. The I’m Out maker in fact, spotted the resemblance in a video shared on his Instagram.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jumani said in the clip, “I just heard this new song called Mast Aankhein on T-series and this is how Jubin Nautiyal looks in the video.” Nautiyal wears long, curly hair styled exactly the way Shah would style his, and looks straight into the camera with his sharp eyes piercing into your soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Am I the only one who thinks that the song is inspired from…” he goes onto ask, before transposing the chorus of Eye to Eye over the T-Series song. And boy, oh boy! Did that leave us dumbfounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jumani captioned his post, \"Share this with your Gen-Z friends to introduce them to the legend, Taher Shah.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The music video for Mast Aankhein even sees Shantanu Maheshwari in white and Nautiyal in black, similar to Shah’s Eye to Eye, where there are two Shahs, one dressed in white and the other in black. While Mast Aankhein sees Maheshwari going gaga over a woman – Shweta Sharda – instead of himself, the chorus of the track says, “Aankh se aankh milao…”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long ago, T-series was called out by musician Farasat Anees, who claimed the label had stolen from his song Biba, which featured in Joyland. “What a disgrace! T-series stealing our work because it has been trending in the world. My brothers and I worked day and night [on] this song. Please have some shame!” he demanded, tagging the company.\n",

      "Ranbir and Shraddha Kapoor’s latest, Tu Jhooti Main Makkaar (TJMM), was off to a rocking start in India, according to Times Now. As per early estimates, the Luv Ranjan directorial was set to rake in INR12 to INR13 crore on day 1 at the box office.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, critics have bombed the film after its release on Holi. The Indian Express (TIE) called it outright “boring” while IANS declared, “Ranbir tries hard to rescue a thin script.” The Hindustan Time (HT) went on to call it a “montage of monologues” while The Print (TP) termed it an “endless drag”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shubhra Gupta noted for TIE that while no Luv Ranjan film can do without a monologue, which is then carried by the film’s plot which is built around it and almost made to justify it, the plot of TJMM is “loose and harebrained as they come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mickey (Ranbir) is, among other things, a break-up artist in the film. Gupta notes that he does this as a ‘dhanda’ wherein he demands a thick fee for his services which entail loosening knots without breaking hearts. “Go on, roll your eyes. It’s Luv Ranjan’s universe, in which the expert couple-buster Mickey falls hard for Tinny (Shraddha), who, you know, just wants to have fun. Ouch. A Casanova-type developing real feelings for a girl who couldn’t care less,” writes Gupta.\n",
      "\n",
      "She holds that the writers of TJMM, however, missed the memo on brevity being the soul of wit, because of which the film drags on for two hours before it finally picks up pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monika Rawal Kukreja writes about TJMM for HT, “The film plays with the extremes. The funny parts are extremely funny, and the boring parts are intolerably boring.” She says Ranjan makes the most of the actors’ beauty in his latest, with close up shots and what not. But the film is like an undercooked broth made from combining previous Ranbir Kapoor films, and peppered with punches from Pyaar Ka Punchnama and Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety. It also offers cameos that give a crossover feel, “but Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar never comes together as a wholesome script.”\n",
      "\n",
      "IANS notes that while Ranjan’s latest is a step away from his otherwise “misogynistic” rom-coms, “the 164-minute film has nothing concrete in terms of story development and the first half is spent entirely on Mickey displaying his charm and trying every trick in the book to impress Tinny.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The outlet acknowledged, “Luv Ranjan seems to be on a remedial course, for this time his female lead is all-independent, modern and carefree but with a solid sense of commitment. For a change, it is the male lead who is a bit of a brat and a tad unscrupulous. The story is definitely a complete turnaround! But the film defies logic” It went as far as stating, “Not that one is looking for any — and is too focused on absurdities. To think that there’s so much ongoing drama could be so exhausting, makes you struggle to firmly remain seated.”\n",

It also stripped her of the obsession she, and most of us have developed with confusing self-love and the need to fit into beauty standards. “It’s like my cancer told me, ‘Nadia, you don’t need to hide behind your hair anymore. This is your face, and it's all you have. So look at it and love it.’ And I was very proud of my long thick hair back then by the way. But when cancer stripped away that pride from me, I learned to love everything else about myself, which I had been hiding all along.”\n",

      "One would assume that supermodel Mushk Kaleem has it all - a successful career, few accolades, a loving partner and a body to kill for with stunning features to match. However, the model, in 2020, had opened up bout her struggle with body dysmorphia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking to Instagram, Kaleem shared pictures from her journey, in an attempt to empower those who go through similar struggles while failing to appreciate their body. \"2019, was probably the most rewarding year of my career, but when I look back and think about all that I went through last year, I realise that my mental health had completely taken a back seat,\" she wrote. The model then recalled how during the time she was adapting to fame, success and accolades, everyone naturally thought she was \"living the dream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On the contrary, Kaleem \"knew then, that to complain about anything would be unthankful.\" But she admitted that she was hospitalised on her 25th birthday last year. \"I was almost 48 kilos and suffering from severe body dysmorphia. I would spend hours obsessing over my weight, about losing those few inches on my waist, about getting those perfect hips, or about just looking the part,\" she said.\n",

      "\"I had started starving myself, not eating for 24 hours and more, I was abusing drugs, I was unhealthy. I was a 6ft girl suffering from severe anorexia. I would occasionally blackout. I needed help. I think it had less to do with my field of work and more to do with how I was okay with being so self-destructive.\" Kaleem then expressed how she had become comfortable with being unhappy, but assured that hers was a happy story. \"Now, a year later, I’m a happier person. I’ve been clean for more than a year. I have found support and happiness in my family, friends, and pets. I have set boundaries that I never let people cross.\"\n",

      "In a scathing statement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif criticised former premier and PTI chief Imran Khan for his non-appearance before the courts. The premier labeled Imran as a \"destroyer of the economy\" and accused him of conspiring to stop the economic recovery through political instability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shehbaz commented on the continuous non-appearance of Imran in the Toshakhana case, saying that he was doing to the courts what he did to national interests, global lenders, friendly countries, the Constitution, parliament, institutions, media, among others. He further stated that Imran was not showing up even when he was summoned by the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "The premier also accused the deposed prime minister of doing to the court what he did to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.

      "Women’s emancipation\n",
      "Aurat March since 2018 in Pakistan has become a symbol of women’s empowerment movement. At the same time, it has been in the eye of storm primarily owing to its not-so-specified agenda, apart from being laced with some catchy sloganeering, which has put it at odds with the conventional citizenry who suspect a foreign hand behind it. But the good point is that it has gained credence as the civil society, especially the womenfolk and the neglected sections, see it as a path to seek emancipation of the fairer sex and eulogise its potential in a male-dominated milieu. This is so because the Constitution guarantees equal rights to both genders, and the courts have been intuitively positive to take a stand against bigotry and discrimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, too, the International Day for Women was not free for ripples. A section of people challenged it in the court of law, calling for a ban on it. Their stated assumption was taboos as many believe such a march by the so-called inferior sex is an attempt to devalue the norms of society. The High Courts in Punjab and Sindh not only ruled against banning the march, but also slapped penalties on petitioners for their mischievous and divisive campaigns. This has, inevitably, helped in establishing the stated principles of law and Constitution, and at the same time ensured the rights of freedom of speech and association.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today as the Aurat March hits the streets, there is a responsibility on its participants and organisers. Stick to the theme, ‘Feminism in times of crisis’, which is intended to highlight pestering social issues such as food insecurity, violence against women and transgender persons, economic justice, man-made disasters and climate justice. It would not be an overstatement to say that women are more impacted with them, as they are the first line of casualty as they take care of their home and wards, and likewise, are bread-winners too in this patriarchal society. Domestic repression and denial of instant justice has been there for long. Time to choreograph it in a civil way with strict adherence to established norms.\n",

      "Crushing public debt\n",
      "Further underscoring the economic miseries of the people is a figure in the Ministry of Finance’s annual report on per capita debt, which went past the Rs200,000 mark for the first time. Debt per capita rose by 21% in just one year between June 2021 and June 2022 which, worryingly, was well before the record inflation and devaluation in the current fiscal year, meaning the real number today is actually much higher. The fiscal policy statement, which should be placed before the National Assembly in a few days, is a scathing indictment of the PDM and PTI governments — the PDM’s inability to fix what was broken and the PTI’s broken promises of fiscal responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the report rightly calls out former finance minister Shaukat Tarin’s “prioritising economic growth at the cost of a higher fiscal deficit” as being one of the reasons for the “problematic fiscal situation”, it does not appear that the incumbents have learned this lesson any more than the PTI, since Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar are wholeheartedly going down the same road with unsustainable and unnecessary projects. The report also says that consumption-driven economic growth was part of the problem, as investment-backed growth is more sustainable. It notes how the intentional overheating of the economy post-Covid by encouraging consumption created the illusion of economic prosperity, even though productivity was mostly flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the steep decline in the government’s non-tax receipts — down 46% —actually reflects the artificial nature of the growth PTI leaders are claiming as an achievement. But there was veiled praise for the PTI, as the report slammed Tarin’s “expansionary fiscal policy stance” for reversing “the consolidation gains achieved in the preceding two years” which corresponds with the PTI’s first two years. Meanwhile, unnecessary subsidies continue to be a drain, and the government still refuses to cut them to a sustainable, or at least less nauseating level.\n",

      "Age limit for marriage\n",
      "Diverting from past tradition, the Federal Sharia Court has made a landmark judgment that fixing an age limit for marriage by the state is not against the injections of Islam. Instead, it is permissible under the Quran and the Sunnah, so that an individual achieves physical as well as mental maturity. It must also be considered that the nikkah is a social contract with the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has long been globally established that the age of maturity in the contemporary era equates to 18 years. Only a patriarchal and conservative approach to religion will dismiss claims of age restriction. Deliberate misinterpretations and misinformation regarding the matter have led to the menace of child marriage and forced marriage wherein middle-aged men often seek to marry underage females from rural areas in exchange for money. Clerics that are either in connivance with them or lack fundamental knowledge often go ahead with the nikkah, not knowing the cruel repercussions that females face. Trafficking has also remained rampant because of this and these young girls are often forced into prostitution. These are not one-off cases and trends including a plethora of cases are well-documented in various reports. Another aspect worth noting is that in the social media era, young immature children often fall into love traps and instead of focusing on strengthening their life they run away to get married. Setting the precedence of a minimum age will help mitigate all these issues and give individuals a chance to at least receive basic education.\n",
      "\n",
      "The state setting this precedence, which is then backed up by religious institutions, will legally give strength to the cause and even work to protect females who are often exploited in this situation. Unfortunately, not all provinces are on the same page yet. A consensus needs to be reached and a single uniform legal age must be set across the board.\n",

      "The writer is the Advocacy Lead for Web 3.0 at IPRI. She is also the Founder of Folkloristan, a digital storytelling platform, focused on digitising and documenting Pakistani folklore\n",
      "\n",
      "The heritage-tech industry illustrates how art and historical assets are documented, preserved and exhibited using technology. Within the umbrella of this nascent industry fall practitioners, academics, and institutions involved in heritage conservation, archaeology, history, tourism, folklore, languages, music, arts, creative industries, media, tech and culture. Some technologies becoming increasingly mainstream are Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Blockchain and NFTs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ubiquitous digitisation enables promising options for cultural heritage preservation, particularly from an academic perspective. Whilst current methods of preserving archaic histories will remain the gold standard, it is essential to link heritage science to technology. However, multidisciplinary approaches to using technology, to aid cultural heritage conservation, must be brought into the mainstream national discourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a pressing need to explore technological solutions to Pakistan’s heritage problem. It’s because several heritage sites have been conserved, and we have ample records of conditions which may result in degradation of heritage sites or transform the authentic experience. Renovations and maintenance may obscure heritage sites. They also may be destroyed by natural occurrences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, inaccessibility for the public at large is also plausible because of geographical limitations. Records then become the only way for academics and people to access these sites. Proportional and aesthetic relationships of historical sites can be replicated with Computer Aided Design. Drawings, point clouds and digital models can prove to be excellent tools for replicating these.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s true that visiting a space is not quite the same as viewing it on a computer screen, but use of technology can contribute immensely to conservation for research and educational purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakistan has also previously struggled with both inappropriate restoration and destruction of various heritage sites. Several Gandharan-era artifacts and Stupas were destroyed by TTP during the previous wave of the insurgency in Pakistan. The Hingorani Mariyoon Mosque in Tando Fazal was rebuilt and whitewashed under “restoration” claims. The reconstruction at Sandeman Fort also became subject to criticism for ruining heritage. Recently, the Makli Necropolis in Sindh, one of the largest funerary sites in the world, was under floodwater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should Pakistan look towards Web 3.0 for heritage conservation, it can leverage emerging tech to position itself as a leader in the heritage-tech space five years from now. Not only will it fuel investment, excellent PR and soft power projection, it will help historicise our own people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Present-day Pakistan is home to several civilisations and the cradle for powerful dynasties. Pakistan can and must claim the entirety of its history as its own. Acknowledging heritage is the first step towards building a society which is self-aware. Nations that fail to maintain and build digital identities risk slipping into oblivion in a digital world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lack of information about Pakistan, its communities, history and culture in the virtual world can and must be looked at as an existential threat. The vacuum of information leaves us susceptible to threats of disinformation from hostile powers, both internal and external.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakistan can explore several solutions in light of Web 3.0 technologies for conservation, curation and dissemination of information related to its cultural heritage. Besides nation building, it can serve as a tool for soft power projection on the global stage. This will allow Pakistan the leverage to market itself as a developing country eager to jump onto emerging tech.\n",
      "\n",
      "A proactive approach needs to be adopted towards fostering international partnerships for cost-effective and environmentally sustainable heritage conservation. Partners can include universities, cultural institutions across the globe, museums and corporates working within the heritage-tech sector to map out detailed frameworks, developing technological solutions and viable investment models.\n",

      "\n",
      "Today’s cascading crises, from the war in Ukraine to the climate emergency, affect women and girls first and worst. And as part of the global pushback against democracy, women’s rights over their bodies and autonomy over their lives are being questioned and denied.\n",

      "This is one of my core priorities and a central plank of the work of the United Nations around the world.

      "\n",
      "This year, International Women’s Day focuses on closing gender gaps in science, technology and innovation. Globally, men are 21% more likely to be online than women, and over 50% more likely in low-income countries. But even the richest countries lose out because of gender-based stereotypes and historic bias. In the tech industry, men outnumber women two to one. In Artificial Intelligence, it’s five to one. Big data is the new gold, and the foundation of today’s political and business decisions. But it often ignores gender differences — or turns a blind eye to women altogether.\n",

Women account for just 3% of Nobel Prize winners in scientific categories since 1901. And women online — including scientists and journalists — are often targeted for sexist hate speech and abuse designed to silence and shame them.\n",

      "\n",
      "We need action on several fronts to make sure women and girls can make their full contribution to the world’s knowledge through science and technology. We must break down barriers — from discriminatory data to stereotypes that push girls away from studying scientific subjects at an early age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decisionmakers of all kinds must broaden women’s participation and leadership in science and technology, through quotas if necessary. They should be creative, widening the recruitment pipeline and hiring for skills. And they must be persistent. Gender equality will not happen by itself; it has to be prioritised and pursued. This approach is getting results at the United Nations, where we have our own strategy for gender parity among our personnel.\n",

      "Steering the country on the right course\n",
      "In the lives of nations due to cumulative failures of leadership in governance, infighting among major political parties and institutional waywardness, the situation reaches a major crisis threshold. We have been facing that moment for a few years and it is getting worse day by day with a large cross-section of the people being crushed by its consequences. The more serious aspect is that the warped response of the government to deal with the situation is likely to further compound the crisis and increase the suffering of the broad masses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The present power structure of the PML-N government is so personal-oriented, defying even the basics of democratic governance. Nawaz Sharif’s hold on the party and on the present government is so dominant that all key appointments in government as well as major policy decisions are being made through remote control, making the situation more complex. It is an established norm in democratic country that when the minister or head of a department fails to deliver and is unable to rise to a serious challenge affecting the country, he resigns. The defiance of the finance minister to continue unabashedly reflects several weaknesses. It appears performance, efficiency and serving the people are secondary, nor is there accountability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The on and off absence of the PTI from the parliament has been another setback depriving the country of institutional checks and balances. A different situation would have emerged if financial and monetary policies were made after scrutiny by the parliament and an assertive cabinet. It would be no exaggeration to assume that the attitude of IMF would have been more accommodative. And so would have been the approach of major powers and traditional allies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the nation failed to pursue its course in accordance with the constitution from its very early beginnings. The politicians in connivance with the army leadership strayed the country in a quagmire due to deliberate distortion of the constitution. Our destiny would have been very different if we had respected the sanctity of the constitution like other developing countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it is important to be conscious of the past and present wayward policies and the lost time, the resolve to correct course should be undertaken on high priority. The first step is to ensure national and provincial elections are held as mandated in the constitution. Any lame reasons for delay will be tantamount to defying the constitution and Supreme Court orders. These should be conducted fairly and seen to be fair so that it does not lead to another crisis of credibility with the losing party demonstrating on the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the maze of the prevailing confusion what we are failing to discern is the extensive politicisation of our society that is leading to waste of national time and effort. The discourse in the parliament is primarily centred on blaming the opponents and the television and social media spends most of its time on confrontational politics. And so do many people, including in offices and even homes that distracts them from focusing on their primary functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt criticism and blame game is part of a democratic culture but has to be accompanied by substantive discussion and workable solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The present economic situation required a serious debate in both houses of the parliament. The expected IMF deal and the recent long drawn speech of the finance minister demanded a sober and well thought-out response from the opposition. There were statements and criticism but a serious parliamentary debate was lacking to correct course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another highly disconcerting trend is the perpetuation of personalised politics around certain families. Leaders are expected to address real issues and make every effort to lessen the enormous burden that the people are facing. Empty talk by leaders in public meetings and bragging about their exaggerated past achievements and future goals are making no dent on them. Especially during hard times, leaders should be forthright and come out with specific plans that satisfy not only international donors but the people whose suffering has known no bounds. The PML-N government should have the moral courage to resign as they are unable to lead and implement even the minimum agenda to stabilise the economy. Instead of walking the talk, their performance is full of contradictions that are turning on them as we are already witnessing. Confusion and chaos are a recipe for aggravating the economic crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only way out of this impending disaster that is lurking right in our face demands that the government and the opposition forego their false egos, stop blaming each other and allow the election commission to conduct the elections fairly. It is critical that political parties accept the results gracefully. The forthcoming elections provide a great opportunity to the army leadership to demonstrate that they are faithfully pursuing the policy of being apolitical. These are accepted norms in mature democracies but for Pakistan, defiance of constitutional obligations has been the model. The dilemma is that we are oblivious how much the country is losing and the people suffering due to these failings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strength and vigour of a nation depends on the will and endeavours of its people, in which the role of leadership and of the political party is crucial. This aspect is regrettably missing in our country as the focus of leaders is elsewhere and prospects of any change appear slim. The intellectual community, although relatively small, also lies dormant. Whereas, in these turbulent times there is as much a need for them to give a new vision and hope to liberate us from the despondency and political bankruptcy that has gripped the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A point to ponder: as the nation hopefully would go to polls soon to elect their representatives to the parliament, will the hold of local moneyed landlords and officials continue to dominate or the electorate will be able to freely choose their representatives? Unless the latter happens, ordinary citizens would never acquire the political power or influence that inherently is their prerogative.\n",

      "India's oil deals with Russia dent decades-old dollar dominance\n",

      "\n",
      "U.S.-led international sanctions on Russia have begun to erode the dollar's decades-old dominance of international oil trade as most deals with India - Russia's top outlet for seaborne crude - have been settled in other currencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dollar's pre-eminence has periodically been called into question and yet it has continued because of the overwhelming advantages of using the most widely-accepted currency for business.\n",
      "\n",
      "India's oil trade, in response to the turmoil of sanctions and the Ukraine war, provides the strongest evidence so far of a shift into other currencies that could prove lasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The country is the world's number three importer of oil and Russia became its leading supplier after Europe shunned Moscow's supplies following its invasion of Ukraine begun in February last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a coalition opposed to the war imposed an oil price cap on Russia on Dec. 5, Indian customers have paid for most Russian oil in non-dollar currencies, including the United Arab Emirates dirham and more recently the Russian rouble, multiple oil trading and banking sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The transactions in the last three months total the equivalent of several hundred million dollars, the sources added, in a shift that has not previously been reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Group of Seven economies, the European Union and Australia, agreed the price cap late last year to bar Western services and shipping from trading Russian oil unless sold at an enforced low price to deprive Moscow of funds for its war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some Dubai-based traders, and Russian energy companies Gazprom and Rosneft are seeking non-dollar payments for certain niche grades of Russian oil that have in recent weeks been sold above the $60 a barrel price cap, three sources with direct knowledge said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sources asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those sales represent a small share of Russia's total sales to India and do not appear to violate the sanctions, which U.S. officials and analysts predicted could be skirted by non-Western services, such as Russian shipping and insurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three Indian banks backed some of the transactions, as Moscow seeks to de-dollarise its economy and traders to avoid sanctions, the trade sources, as well as former Russian and U.S. economic officials, told Reuters.\n",
      "\n",
      "But continued payment in dirhams for Russian oil could become harder after the United States and Britain last month added Moscow and Abu Dhabi-based Russian bank MTS to the Russian financial institutions on the sanctions list.\n",
      "\n",
      "MTS had facilitated some Indian oil non-dollar payments, the trade sources said. Neither MTS nor the U.S. Treasury immediately responded to a Reuters request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "An Indian refining source said most Russian banks have faced sanctions since the war but Indian customers and Russian suppliers are determined to keep trading Russian oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Russian suppliers will find some other banks for receiving payments,\" the source told Reuters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As it is, the government is not asking us to stop buying Russian oil, so we are hopeful that an alternative payment mechanism will be found in case the current system is blocked.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Friendly versus unfriendly\n",
      "\n",
      "Paying for oil in dollars has been the nearly universal practice for decades. By comparison, the currency's share of overall international payments is much smaller at 40%, according to January figures from payment system SWIFT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daniel Ahn, a former chief economist at the U.S. State Department and now a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, says the dollar's strength is unmatched, but the sanctions could undermine the West's financial systems while failing to achieve their aim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Russia's short-term efforts to try and sell things in return for currencies other than the dollar is not the real threat to Western sanctions,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"(The West) is weakening the competitiveness of their own financial services by adding yet another administrative layer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The price cap coincided with an EU embargo on imports of Russian seaborne oil, rounding off a year of bans and sanctions, including largely expelling Russia from the SWIFT global payments system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around half of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, which stood near $640 billion, were frozen.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, Russia said it would seek payment for its energy in the currency of \"friendly\" countries and last year ordered \"unfriendly\" EU states to pay for gas in roubles.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Russian firms - as payments were blocked or delayed even if they were not violating any sanctions, due to overly zealous compliance - dollars became potentially a \"toxic asset\", independent analyst and former adviser at the Bank of Russia Alexandra Prokopenko, said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Russia desperately needs to trade with the rest of the world because it's still dependent on its oil and gas revenues so they are trying all options they have,\" she told Reuters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They're working on building a direct infrastructure between the Russian and Indian banking systems.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "India’s largest lender State Bank of India has a nostro, or foreign currency, account in Russia. Similarly, many banks from Russia have opened accounts with Indian banks to facilitate trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "IMF Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath said in the month after Russia's invasion of Ukraine that sanctions on Russia could erode the dollar's dominance by encouraging smaller trading blocs using other currencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The dollar would remain the major global currency even in that landscape but fragmentation at a smaller level is certainly quite possible,\" she told the Financial Times. The IMF did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond Russia, tensions between China and the West are also eroding the long-established norms of dollar-dominated global trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia holds a chunk of its currency reserves in renminbi while China has reduced its holdings of dollars, and Russian President Vladimir Putin said in September Moscow had agreed to sell gas supplies to China for yuan and roubles instead of dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "India displaces Europe\n",
      "\n",
      "India in the last year displaced Europe as Russia's top customer for seaborne oil, snapping up cheap barrels and increasing imports of Russian crude 16-fold compared to before the war, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency. Russian crude accounted for about a third of its total imports.\n",
      "\n",
      "While India does not recognise the sanctions against Moscow, the majority of purchases of Russian oil in any currency have complied with them, trade sources said, and almost all sales have taken place at levels below the price cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, most banks and financial institutions are cautious about clearing any payments to avoid unwittingly breaching any international law.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Indian refiners that in recent weeks started settling some Russian oil purchases in roubles, according to the trade sources, payments have been processed in part by the State Bank of India via its nostro roubles account in Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those transactions are mostly for oil purchases from Russian state energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft, the sources added. Bank of Baroda and Axis Bank have handled most of the dirham payments, the sources added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The banks, Gazprom and Rosneft did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "India has prepared a framework for settling trade with Russia in Indian rupees should rouble transactions be cut off by further sanctions, the sources said.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. How did it start and in which cities did reports appear?\n",
      "\n",
      "The first poisoning cases of schoolgirls were reported on Nov. 30, 2022 at the Qom Girls' Art School (Huneristan-i Qom) in the city of Qom. Eighteen girls were poisoned there.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the following days, more than 500 students were poisoned in Qom.\n",

      "\n",
      "When she became pregnant in 2021, Gunnarsdottir's wages were slashed by Lyon, the eight-time European women's champions, and she said her bosses showed little understanding when she returned to training after having her baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an article for the Players' Tribune, Gunnarsdottir recounted how one of Lyon's directors failed to reply to her representatives until she lodged a formal complaint after she was not paid for two months.\n",

      "When will Pakistan attain women protection and empowerment?\n",
      "A lot more must be done to address the causes of violence against women and change mindset to promote gender equality\n",
      "\n",
      "International Women's Day is celebrated on March 8th every year. It's a global celebration of the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. It is also a day to recognise the ongoing struggles that women face in achieving gender equality and to call for action to address these challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The origins of International Women's Day can be traced back to the early 20th century when women's movements began to gain momentum around the world. The first National Women's Day was observed in the United States on February 28, 1909, to commemorate garment workers’ strike in New York City. The following year, Socialist International established International Women's Day to promote women's suffrage and to recognise the contributions of women in all spheres.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1917, women in Russia organised a strike for \"Bread and Peace\" during World War I, demanding an end to the war and better living conditions. This strike, which began on March 8th, was a catalyst for the Russian Revolution and helped establish women's rights in Russia. In 1975, the United Nations officially recognised International Women's Day, and it has since become a day to highlight gender inequalities and advocate for women's rights and empowerment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Pakistan, the celebration takes place with various events, activities and campaigns to raise awareness about women's rights and gender equality. The day is observed by women's organisations, civil society groups and human rights activists. One of the main events held on Women's Day in Pakistan is the Aurat March (Women's March). It is a grassroots movement that started in 2018 and aims to raise awareness about women's issues and demand greater gender equality in Pakistani society. Aurat March is organised in different cities across Pakistan and is attended by women and men from all walks of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, there have been some controversies and backlash against Women's Day celebrations in Pakistan, particularly regarding the Aurat March. Some conservative groups have criticised the movement for promoting “western values” and have accused it of being “anti-Islam”. However, the organisers of Aurat March and other Women's Day events continue to push for greater gender equality and to challenge patriarchal norms and attitudes in Pakistani society.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also true that women in Pakistan face various forms of violence, including domestic violence, honour killings, acid attacks, sexual harassment, and forced marriages. Domestic violence is one of the most prevalent forms of violence against women in Pakistan. A survey conducted by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics found that 32 per cent of women aged 15-49 have experienced physical violence at the hands of their husbands. This violence includes beatings, burning, and even murder. Honour killings and acid attacks have also been increasingly high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexual harassment is another issue that women in Pakistan face. A survey conducted by the Aurat Foundation found that 97 per cent of women in Pakistan have experienced some form of sexual harassment in public places.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pakistani government has taken steps to address violence against women, including passing laws to protect women's rights and establishing crisis centres and hotlines for women in distress. However, a lot more must be done to address the root causes of violence against women and change the mindset perpetuating this violence in Pakistani society. Some of the major laws in Pakistan relating to violence against women include:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act, 2006: This law amended the Pakistan Penal Code to include harsher penalties for offences against women, such as rape, acid attacks and honour killings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prevention of Anti-Women Practices Act, 2011: This law criminalises several harmful practices against women, including forced marriages, giving women in marriage as part of a dispute settlement, and depriving women of their inheritance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, 2013: This law provides legal protection to women against domestic violence and abuse, and it allows women to obtain restraining orders against their abusers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Act, 2011: This law criminalises acid attacks and provides harsh penalties for those who commit this offence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Punjab Protection of Women Against Violence Act, 2016: This law was passed by the Punjab government and provided comprehensive protection to women against all forms of violence, including physical, psychological, and economic abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protecting women in Pakistan from violence and promoting gender equality requires a multi-faceted approach involving individuals, communities and civil society organisations. The government may require the following major steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengthening the legal framework:\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are several laws in place in Pakistan to protect women from violence, implementation and enforcement of these laws remains a challenge. The government needs to take steps to ensure that the legal framework is implemented effectively and that perpetrators of violence against women are held accountable for their actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Increasing awareness and education:\n",
      "\n",
      "Raising awareness about women's rights and gender equality is crucial to changing attitudes and behaviour towards women in Pakistani society. Education about gender equality should be incorporated into school curricula, and awareness-raising campaigns should be launched to promote women's rights and challenge patriarchal norms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Providing support services:\n",
      "\n",
      "Women who experience violence need access to a range of support services, including medical care, counselling and legal assistance. The government should establish more crisis centres and shelters for women, and these services should be adequately resourced and staffed by trained professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Empowering women economically:\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic empowerment is key to reducing women's vulnerability to violence and abuse. The government should provide support to women entrepreneurs and promote women's participation in the formal economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengthening community-based initiatives:\n",
      "\n",
      "Community-based initiatives can be effective in preventing violence against women and promoting gender equality. These initiatives could include women's groups, community dialogues, and awareness-raising campaigns at the grassroots level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Addressing cultural and religious practices that discriminate against women:\n",
      "\n",
      "Many cultural and religious practices in Pakistan discriminate against women and reinforce patriarchal attitudes. Efforts should be made to challenge these practices and to promote more progressive interpretations of religion and culture that support gender equality.\n",
      "\n",
      "These steps require a sustained and coordinated effort from all stakeholders, including the government, civil society organisations, and communities. It'll take time to achieve meaningful change, but protecting the rights and dignity of women in Pakistan is essential.\n",

      "Five facts about Holi, the festival of colours\n",
      "How do many celebrate Holi? From its origin in Hindu legend to special drinks spiced with fresh cannabis, here are some basics about Holi, which is being celebrated today.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The origins of Holi\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Hindu calendar, Holi falls on the last full moon of winter. Traditionally, it is celebrated in the northern parts of India, but is now popular across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legend has it that a king of the demons — Hiranyakashyipu — demanded that everyone worship him as a god. But his son, Prahlad, opposed him, which made the king angry. Hiranyakashyipu devised many evil plans to kill his son, but failed miserably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the king's sister, Holika, who was a sorceress, decided to make it her mission to kill the boy. She would sit in a giant bonfire with Prahlad and while her magic powers would protect her, the boy would die. However, her plans likewise failed. The boy survived, while the sorceress burned to cinders.\n",
      "\n",
      "In many regions, the Holi festival heralds the passing of the cold winter season and the advent of warmer weather, but it also celebrates the victory of good over evil. In Mathura, in northern India, people observe Holi as a celebration of the love between the Hindu god Krishna and his lady love, Radha, and reenact scenes from their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Traditional Holi food\n",
      "\n",
      "Every Holi festivity in India is associated with the special food that is prepared to celebrate the event. The homemade \"gujiya,\" a mix of nuts and raisins encased in sweet pastry, is traditionally prepared by women in the family on the previous evening of the holiday. Other traditional Holi dishes include \"malpua\" — fried sweet pancakes; stuffed breads, called \"kachoris\" — and the ubiquitous \"laddoos,\" dessert balls made of coconut, wheat or chickpea flour.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The traditional Holi drink\n",
      "\n",
      "Holi is incomplete without the traditional bhang, a drink made of fresh cannabis leaves. A couple of days before Holi, bhang enthusiasts join hands to undertake the tedious task of separating the buds and leaves from the cannabis sativa plant and grind them into a paste. The mixture is added to traditional sweets or mixed with sweetened almond milk as a treat for the special day.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. It's Holi-day!\n",
      "\n",
      "Festivities start in the evening when families set up bonfires to symbolise the burning of Holika, the sorceress who wanted to kill Prahlad. On the day of Holi, revelers partake of a traditional Indian breakfast and gather with their families and friends to celebrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Holi Hai,\" Hindi for \"it's Holi,\" is a cue for everyone to gather in one spot, throw and spray colours at each other, and generally make a racket. If you're lucky, you'll get away with good-quality organic colour on your person and minimal harassment. If you're unlucky, enthusiastic crowds may carry and dump you into the nearest muddy puddle or you may find yourself doused with permanent, artificial colours that leave your hair and face purple for days on end.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Holi songs\n",
      "\n",
      "Songs, including folksongs and Bollywood hits, are a Holi fixture. Neighbourhoods often blast religious and festive dance music from stereo speakers placed where people gather to play around with paints and colours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many songs, especially Bollywood numbers, have become synonymous with Holi in the past several decades. Perhaps the most popular voice associated with a Holi song is the one sung by Bollywood super star Amitabh Bachchan. Rang Barse is quintessential Holi, replete with drugs, dancing, adulterous flirtation and sexual innuendo.\n",

      "\"Domestic violence is primarily about power. It is an ugly manifestation of one person's attempt to subjugate another and exert their authority over them. The abuser seeks to bring cruelty to the table and assert their dominance by insisting that the victim is not equal but a subordinate. Unfortunately, it is a form of exercise of power that has become so normalized that people have become comfortable with it,” the minister said.\n",
      "\n",
      "She highlighted that is not a law of nature or civilization, but merely the law of the jungle that allows such behavior. She went further to state that this normalization can be attributed to patriarchal norms and culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rehman said that domestic violence is the hidden global pandemic that continues to affect women. “One of the problems we face is that we do not go far enough to challenge these norms. We create laws, but their enforcement is often diluted as bargains and trades are made outside the court. This culture is prevalent all over the world, and it needs to change. Domestic violence is the hidden pandemic that the world still shamefully lives in the 21st century,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The statistics are staggering as 90% of women faces some form of domestic violence in their lifetime, yet 50% of them do not report it, and only 0.4% of them go to court. Those who do report it often face shame and condemnation, and being told to keep silent about it is just as criminal as the violence itself. It is essential to disrupt the social consensus on keeping quiet about issues that disturb the status quo. Our society is layered with patriarchy, and it subjugates women through a series of institutional, social, and cultural norms that allow and normalize violence against women,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minister also said that it is the elite segments of society that should be expected to push back first against such norms as these are the people who have accumulated power and have the resources to challenge such norms.\n",
      "\n",
      "She expressed disappointment that despite starting work on the Domestic Violence Bill in 2004, it remains unpassed almost 20 years later. However, she also noted that many other bills have been successfully passed, and we should take pride in those accomplishments. “It is essential to understand that societal issues are all interconnected, and none of them exist in isolation. The status of women is a crucial factor that underlies all these issues. Fortunately, in the constitution of Pakistan, women are recognized as equal citizens, but this constitution is repeatedly abused, and women's rights are violated in homes and public places,” the Minister remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minister stated that while domestic violence used to be a hot topic in the 90s, it has become overshadowed by other injustices faced by women and vulnerable communities. The Minister cited the catastrophic flooding in 2022 that impacted 33 million people, with women facing the most challenges as their livelihoods and shelters were swept away.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also lamented the fact that violence against women in conflict areas, climate-stressed areas, and other fragile environments often goes undocumented. They bear a disproportionate burden of these challenges, and the Minister emphasized the need for change.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As long as there are enough of us to raise our voices, fight against it, and remind others that it is a problem that has been around since the dawn of history and civilisation, change is possible.\n",

      "Supreme Court’s landmark judgment in a suo motu case dealing with the delay in holding election to the provincial assemblies of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa has evinced a national debate. The Supreme Court has ordered election to the dissolved provincial assemblies to be held within 90 days, in pursuance with the stipulated dictum of the Constitution. The apex court also determined the crucial issue of who is responsible for announcing the election date, ruling that in the case of Punjab, President’s April 9 date is ‘constitutionally competent’ because the assembly had not been dissolved by the Governor, while in the case of K-P, the date announced by the President is invalid, and the Governor shall announce the date in consultation with the ECP because the assembly had been dissolved by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The top court also directed the ECP to be ‘proactively’ available to the President or Governor for consultation on dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The split 3-2 judgment has, however, triggered a heated debate, with both the government and the opposition interpreting it to their favour and declaring it as their victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one side of the divide are those who opine that the Constitution is clear that election to a dissolved assembly has to be held with 90 days; and that the case should not even have gone to the Supreme Court. But they also find the judgment ambiguous, given the leniency that the ECP can deviate from deadline to the ‘barest minimum’. They insist that it leaves it to the subjective whims of the electoral body, creating confusion over determining the minimum deviation. As a consequence, delay in elections cannot be ruled out.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also believed that the split judgment has further complicated the issue, as the ECP has to announce the date, which may further lead to political acrimony and turmoil. The specific footnote by two dissenting judges has also provided enough material to the government’s team to build their case, arguing that the Supreme Court’s was a 4-3 majority decision in their favour, and not a 3-2 verdict against them. However, most legal experts opine that the government is stretching too far to derive their own meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Banking on the dissenting note by two judges, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and Attorney General Shehzad Ata Elahi insist that there is no need to file any review petition before the Supreme Court nor is there the need for further interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary to the view held by the government, many of the jurists are of the view that the 3-2 judgment will hold good, as there were two different benches at two different points in time and any conflation of the two was ‘absurd and illogical’.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the divergent view explained above, it appears that attempts are being made to blur the real issue in the welter of controversy on whether suo motu action should have been taken or whether the issue should have been heard by full court.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting aside the technicalities and legal intricacies, the main issue is transfer of power to the people through their chosen representatives. Can they be deprived of their fundamental right to elect representatives of their choice? Can there be taxation without representation?\n",
      "\n",
      "In this context, the judgment has rightly pointed out that “Parliamentary democracy is a salient feature of the Constitution. There can be no parliamentary democracy without Parliament or the provincial assemblies … And there can be neither Parliament nor provincial assemblies without the holding of general elections as envisaged, required and mandated by and under the Constitution and in accordance therewith.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The aforementioned discussion expresses the scheme of the Constitution. Under the rules of interpretation, and views of the Apex Courts, a constitutional instrument has, in first instance, to be interpreted in the same manner as any other statute and the cardinal rule here is that the function of the court called upon to interpret any of the provision is to ascertain the intention of the makers of the Constitution from the words used which must receive their natural and ordinary meaning. Where the words are clear and establish only one meaning, that meaning is to be assigned to them even if the result is harsh and/or absurd, as the Court is not concerned with the policy of the Statute. Furthermore, a constitution has to be read as whole and every clause and word of it must be given full effect. The Court should avoid a construction which renders any provision meaningless or inoperative and must lean in favour of a construction which will render every word operative rather than one which may make some words idle and nugatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the forgoing discussion, and reading the Constitution as a whole, it is clear that the Constitution of Pakistan sets up a Federal Republic with a Parliamentary form of government for both the Centre and the provinces. In essence, foundation of the Constitution is democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph 3 of the preamble of the Constitution, emphasising the representative character of the polity, states it to be the will of the people and that the State should exercise its power and authority through the chosen representatives of the people, with the persons exercising its power being representatives because they are chosen by the people. The intention of the legislature for all purposes is to establish a representative form of government as understood in the constitutional law. Therefore, no deviation can take place on one pretext or the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The upshot of the aforementioned deliberation is that democracy cannot function without chosen representatives and chosen representatives cannot be there without elections. Therefore, after the dissolution of assemblies, holding elections is sine qua non for democracy.\n",

      "A lot more must be done to address the causes of violence against women and change mindset to promote gender equality\n",
      "\n",
      "International Women's Day is celebrated on March 8th every year. It's a global celebration of the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. It is also a day to recognise the ongoing struggles that women face in achieving gender equality and to call for action to address these challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The origins of International Women's Day can be traced back to the early 20th century when women's movements began to gain momentum around the world. The first National Women's Day was observed in the United States on February 28, 1909, to commemorate garment workers’ strike in New York City. The following year, Socialist International established International Women's Day to promote women's suffrage and to recognise the contributions of women in all spheres.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1917, women in Russia organised a strike for \"Bread and Peace\" during World War I, demanding an end to the war and better living conditions. This strike, which began on March 8th, was a catalyst for the Russian Revolution and helped establish women's rights in Russia. In 1975, the United Nations officially recognised International Women's Day, and it has since become a day to highlight gender inequalities and advocate for women's rights and empowerment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Pakistan, the celebration takes place with various events, activities and campaigns to raise awareness about women's rights and gender equality. The day is observed by women's organisations, civil society groups and human rights activists. One of the main events held on Women's Day in Pakistan is the Aurat March (Women's March). It is a grassroots movement that started in 2018 and aims to raise awareness about women's issues and demand greater gender equality in Pakistani society. Aurat March is organised in different cities across Pakistan and is attended by women and men from all walks of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, there have been some controversies and backlash against Women's Day celebrations in Pakistan, particularly regarding the Aurat March. Some conservative groups have criticised the movement for promoting “western values” and have accused it of being “anti-Islam”. However, the organisers of Aurat March and other Women's Day events continue to push for greater gender equality and to challenge patriarchal norms and attitudes in Pakistani society.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also true that women in Pakistan face various forms of violence, including domestic violence, honour killings, acid attacks, sexual harassment, and forced marriages. Domestic violence is one of the most prevalent forms of violence against women in Pakistan. A survey conducted by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics found that 32 per cent of women aged 15-49 have experienced physical violence at the hands of their husbands. This violence includes beatings, burning, and even murder. Honour killings and acid attacks have also been increasingly high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexual harassment is another issue that women in Pakistan face. A survey conducted by the Aurat Foundation found that 97 per cent of women in Pakistan have experienced some form of sexual harassment in public places.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pakistani government has taken steps to address violence against women, including passing laws to protect women's rights and establishing crisis centres and hotlines for women in distress. However, a lot more must be done to address the root causes of violence against women and change the mindset perpetuating this violence in Pakistani society. Some of the major laws in Pakistan relating to violence against women include:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act, 2006: This law amended the Pakistan Penal Code to include harsher penalties for offences against women, such as rape, acid attacks and honour killings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prevention of Anti-Women Practices Act, 2011: This law criminalises several harmful practices against women, including forced marriages, giving women in marriage as part of a dispute settlement, and depriving women of their inheritance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, 2013: This law provides legal protection to women against domestic violence and abuse, and it allows women to obtain restraining orders against their abusers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Act, 2011: This law criminalises acid attacks and provides harsh penalties for those who commit this offence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Punjab Protection of Women Against Violence Act, 2016: This law was passed by the Punjab government and provided comprehensive protection to women against all forms of violence, including physical, psychological, and economic abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protecting women in Pakistan from violence and promoting gender equality requires a multi-faceted approach involving individuals, communities and civil society organisations. The government may require the following major steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengthening the legal framework:\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are several laws in place in Pakistan to protect women from violence, implementation and enforcement of these laws remains a challenge. The government needs to take steps to ensure that the legal framework is implemented effectively and that perpetrators of violence against women are held accountable for their actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Increasing awareness and education:\n",
      "\n",
      "Raising awareness about women's rights and gender equality is crucial to changing attitudes and behaviour towards women in Pakistani society. Education about gender equality should be incorporated into school curricula, and awareness-raising campaigns should be launched to promote women's rights and challenge patriarchal norms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Providing support services:\n",
      "\n",
      "Women who experience violence need access to a range of support services, including medical care, counselling and legal assistance. The government should establish more crisis centres and shelters for women, and these services should be adequately resourced and staffed by trained professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Empowering women economically:\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic empowerment is key to reducing women's vulnerability to violence and abuse. The government should provide support to women entrepreneurs and promote women's participation in the formal economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengthening community-based initiatives:\n",
      "\n",
      "Community-based initiatives can be effective in preventing violence against women and promoting gender equality. These initiatives could include women's groups, community dialogues, and awareness-raising campaigns at the grassroots level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Addressing cultural and religious practices that discriminate against women:\n",
      "\n",
      "Many cultural and religious practices in Pakistan discriminate against women and reinforce patriarchal attitudes. Efforts should be made to challenge these practices and to promote more progressive interpretations of religion and culture that support gender equality.\n",
      "\n",
      "These steps require a sustained and coordinated effort from all stakeholders, including the government, civil society organisations, and communities. It'll take time to achieve meaningful change, but protecting the rights and dignity of women in Pakistan is essential.\n",

      "In his first appearance after assuming the office three months ago, Qin addressed a number of hot-button issues on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People’s Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ongoing Ukraine crisis and festering tensions with the US remained the ominous backdrops of the tone-setting presser that outlined China’s multilateral cooperation efforts and assertive foreign policy agenda to counter what it dubbed ‘cold war style’ bloc politics and bullying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also read: China blames ‘certain developed country’ for Pakistan’s financial woes\n",
      "\n",
      "Striking a no-holds-barred tone, the foreign minister warned 'reckless' US risked 'catastrophic' conflict if ‘brakes’ were not hit and said the ties between the two countries should be guided by common interests, shared responsibilities and friendship between the two peoples, and “not US domestic politics and hysterical neo-McCarthyism”.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘US worsened international debt problem’\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked for his response to western claims that Beijing’s overseas infrastructure investments were part of its ‘debt-trap diplomacy’, the top diplomat said China should be the last country to be accused of the so-called debt trap.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went on to attribute the deepening economic perils of the developing nations to the multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors which account “for over 80 per cent of the sovereign debt of developing countries”.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are the biggest source of debt burden on developing countries,” Qin said and noted that particularly since last year, the unprecedented, rapid interest hikes by the United States have led to capital outflows in many countries and worsened the debt problems in the countries concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "He insisted that China has been making efforts to help the countries in distress, and is the biggest contributor to the G20’s Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), and affirmed that the country will continue to participate constructively in the resolution of international debt issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the foreign minister also called on other parties to act together and share the burden fairly. “When parties sit together and talk things through, there will be more solutions than problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten years after its inception, he noted, the BRI has evolved from vision into reality, boosting development in partner countries and bringing real benefits to the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past decade, the BRI has galvanised nearly US$1 trillion of investment, established more than 3,000 cooperation projects, created 420,000 local jobs, and helped lift almost 40 million people out of poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The BRI is a practical and open initiative guided by the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. Its cooperation is conducted through consultation, and its partnerships are built with friendship and good faith.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We welcome all initiatives that are not ideologically driven proposed by other countries, and we are happy to see them succeed if they don’t carry a geopolitical agenda, the foreign minister added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Airship incident\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of the unmanned airship incident, Qin reiterated that it was purely an accident caused by force majeure. However, the US has violated the spirit of international law and practice by the presumption of guilt, overreacting and dramatising the case, and thus created a diplomatic crisis that could have been avoided.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If the US has the ambition to make America great again, it should also have the grace to let other countries thrive. Suppression will not make the US greater, and it will not stop China's march toward rejuvenation, Qin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The US so-called guardrails or the concept of non-conflict in its relations with China actually means that China must not fight back. But this cannot be done,\" noted Qin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also read: China warns US against suppressing it or risk 'conflict'\n",
      "\n",
      "Such competition is a gamble with the fundamental interests of the two peoples and even the future of mankind, and China is of course firmly opposed to it, Qin remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taiwan first ‘uncrossable red line’\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to a question about Taiwan question, the foreign minister brought out a copy of China’s constitution and read out parts reaffirming its sovereignty.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the issue was the nation's first uncrossable red line. If the Taiwan question is not handled properly, China-US relations will be thrown off course. If the US truly wanted peace across the Taiwan Straits, it should stop using the island to contain China, and make clear its opposition to secessionist forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hoped that the US government will listen to the voices of the two peoples, eliminate the strategic anxiety, abandon a Cold War mentality and reject the unwarranted abduction of \"political correctness,\" but honour its commitments and walk in the same direction as China.\n"

      "UN experts call for probe into Kakar’s death, ‘kill list’\n",
      "The United Nations (UN) has called on the government of Pakistan to investigate the death of former senator Usman Kakar and an alleged “Kill List” that names several individuals to be eliminated. The call was made in a joint letter by four UN Special Rapporteurs on human rights, dated December 27, 2021, which was made public on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The letter urged the government to respond within 60 days, failing which the communication and any response received from the government would be made public and also made available in the report to the Human Rights Council. As of now, the letter does not carry any government response, suggesting that no response has been provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usman Kakar, a member of the Pashtun minority, a former senator and regional leader of the nationalist Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party, was found in his house in Quetta, Balochistan, with blood flowing from a head injury on June 17, 2021. The cause of the head injury is unknown, but there are concerns that he could have been attacked. Ex-Senator Kakar had previously received death threats and referred to them as coming from intelligence agencies in his final speech in parliament.\n",
      "\n",
      "The joint letter by Morris Tidball-Binz, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions; Aua Baldé, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances; Mary Lawlor, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; and Fernand de Varennes, the Special Rapporteur on minority issues, also expressed concern about an alleged “Kill List.”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the letter, the list of at least ten individuals was published in a Facebook post by the former spokesperson of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The post relates to a series of social media posts by a former militant and member of TTP, who surrendered to authorities in April 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also read: Kakar demands new NAP against terrorism\n",
      "\n",
      "The former TTP spokesman claimed in a media interview to have been released from prison following an agreement with the security services. The tweets referred to a “kill list” maintained by agencies, and he had been requested to lead a “death squad” to eliminate “some individuals.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The former militant also named two officers who had asked him to carry out the task, which “was the only way to secure his release.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The TTP spokesperson, Ehsanullah Ehsan, had alleged in a Facebook post in June/ July 2021 that while in captivity, he was given a list of about ten people who were required to be eliminated for their “anti-state activities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The list, according to Ehsan, included former senators Afrasiab Khattak and Farhatullah Babar, a political activist from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Said Alam Mehsud, and Mufti Kifayatullah. Ehsan also claimed that he declined to carry out the assassination orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UN Rapporteurs said that they did not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, but they are raising concern about the death of Kakar, its circumstances, and the alleged existence of the “kill list” containing several names.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Special Rapporteurs urged the government to “provide any additional information” on these allegations, as well as “detailed information on the practical measures that have been taken to ensure the physical and psychological integrity” of those named on the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also asked about the measures taken to ensure that human rights defenders and those raising their voice against enforced disappearances in Pakistan can carry out their peaceful and legitimate work.\n",
      "State involved in enforced disappearances, says IHC CJ\n",
      "Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah on Friday observed that the reality was that the State was itself involved in “enforced disappearances”.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the court heard petitions on the recovery of missing persons, Justice Minallah inquired from the deputy attorney general as to why people were still being “picked up”.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What steps has the federal government taken and who is responsible?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, the deputy attorney general informed the court that the federal cabinet had constituted a committee on missing persons and would make recommendations on these cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IHC CJ further questioned the government representative as to whether or not the government had issued affidavits to former chief executives, including former military ruler General (retd) Pervez Musharraf.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deputy attorney general stated that the affidavits were under the purview of the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP). “He [AGP] is abroad and if given some time, will present his arguments on this matter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Read Musharraf, his successors face notices over ‘enforced disappearances’\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief justice expressed his disappointment with the conduct of the State and remarked that relevant parties were not giving the issue apt significance. “Today, the federal government has proved that it is not serious about such a big issue,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IHC\n",
      "\n",
      "ordered the government to investigate the cases of missing people, adding that it would be preferred if the chief executive of the country was present.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are proving that [forcibly] disappearing people has been the policy of the State since the days of General Musharraf. Someone is responsible for the period in which people go missing,” the judge remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court also stated that if the practice continued and the government failed to comply with the orders of the IHC, they were “largely ineffective”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court then directed the interior ministry to ensure implementation of the May 25 order, adding that no further adjournment would be given in the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The parties should prepare their arguments,” the judge remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case was adjourned till July 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The high court had earlier ordered a detailed report from the Commission for Inquiry on Enforced Disappearance on its performance and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to address the issue of missing persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Minallah had asked the commission to tell the court about how it was formed, what its terms of reference (TORs) were and how they were implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subsequently, the court had directed the federal government to issue notices to Musharraf and all his successive chief executives of the country including incumbent PM Shehbaz Sharif as to why proceedings should not be initiated against them for subversion of the Constitution in the context of the State policy on enforced disappearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Minallah had also remarked that enforced disappearances were unacceptable in a country run under the Constitution and asked why not the chief executive of the country be held responsible for it.\n",
      "Enforced disappearances seem to be the state's policy, says IHC\n",
      "The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday said the presence of internment centres in the country gives an impression that forcibly disappearing people is a policy of the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a hearing of the case pertaining to the recovery of journalist Mudassir Naaru and other missing persons, the IHC chief justice said the state cannot disappear anyone and it’s an established fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "CJ Athar Minallah added it was the duty of the state to protect its citizens but in hindsight, it seemed that the state itself was responsible for disappearing dissidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the hearing, Additional Attorney General Qasim Wudood said the state had no such policy and added that at least 800 people were missing in Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",

      "Bitcoin steadied on Thursday near its lowest since mid-February, after US crypto-focused bank Silvergate said it would voluntarily liquidate, the latest in a series of high-profile crypto collapses triggered by the collapse of the FTX exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silvergate Capital Corp said on Wednesday it planned to close and voluntarily liquidate, after warning last week that it was evaluating its ability to operate as a going concern. The California-based company, which was a key banking partner for crypto businesses, had been hit by investors rushing to withdraw around $8 billion of deposits after the sudden bankruptcy of FTX last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin was last down 0.4% at $21,624, having fallen 2.2% on Wednesday to a 3-1/2 week low of $21,590.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors and analysts said the market impact of the shuttering of Silvergate – seen as an important bridge between the crypto sector and traditional financial world – was limited as it had been widely expected.\n",

      "Cement sector’s profit grows in double digits\n",
      "Despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges, Pakistan’s top cement companies have reported double-digit profit growth in the second quarter of current fiscal year (FY23).\n",
      "\n",
      "“Recent core performance of top cement companies has reflected resilience to the ongoing macro adjustments, bringing the sector back on the radar,” JS Global cement sector analyst Waqas Ghani Kukaswadia stated in a report.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sector reported 14% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) profit growth in Oct-Dec 2022 on the back of higher sales as first quarter (Jul-Sept) was badly hit by disastrous flooding. Earnings in the second quarter were higher by 42% year-on-year (YoY) despite increase in financing charges, he said. Consequently, first-half earnings for cement companies showed an increase of 21% YoY.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucky Cement, DG Khan Cement, Attock Cement, Fauji Cement, Maple Leaf Cement and Pioneer Cement registered 23% rise in their topline in the second quarter of FY23, which took first-half sales to Rs167.8 billion, up by 22.4%, observed Insight Securities’ cement sector analyst Ali Asif.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Revenues jumped mainly because of increase in retention prices by 56%,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, local cement dispatches fell around 17% while exports plunged by 49%, which pushed total sales down to 21.7 million tons, Asif highlighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Decline in sales is attributable to the burgeoning cost of construction, higher interest rates, low utilisation of Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) and political uncertainty, which was further worsened by floods.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, despite the drop in sales, revenues surged amid higher retention prices, which offset the impact of lower offtake, Asif said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Average gross margins this quarter (Oct-Dec) brought a positive surprise. The sector experienced impressive average margins QoQ despite rising input costs and higher inflation in the second quarter, owing to effective coal inventory management,” Kukaswadia wrote in his report.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alternative coal is a blessing in disguise for the cement sector, which keeps margins healthier despite contraction in demand, import restrictions and higher energy prices,” Optimus Research cement sector analyst Mehroz Khan remarked while talking to The Express Tribune.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coal prices, imported from the Richard Bay of South Africa, fell to $124, or around Rs34,461, per ton, the lowest since January 3, 2022, when the price was $121, or Rs21,358, per ton, according to Arif Habib Limited Head of Research Tahir Abbas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coal prices have declined by 73% from their peak of $460, or Rs82,188, per ton hit on March 8, 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Insight Securities’ Asif was of the view that gross margins of cement companies grew by 110 basis points to 24.4% against 23.3% last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "He attributed the surge mainly to the shift to alternative fuel, renewable energy including solar power and waste heat recovery (WHR), complemented by the substitution of local and Afghan coal with imported coal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Profits of cement companies grew around 20% in the first half (Jul-Dec) of FY23 compared to the same period of last year, he said. Their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose by 25.9% in H1, up by 130 basis points against 24.5% in the same period of last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, profit margins shrank by 0.7 percentage point. The decline was attributable to the rising interest rates and increase in debt due to the expansionary cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first half of FY23, about 9.7 million tons of capacity was added by the industry.\n",

      "Wearing a swimsuit on television not acceptable: Atiqa\n",
      "In an exclusive interview, the veteran talks about her journey as an actor, upcoming projects and more\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I feel that if you are really pouring out your heart into your craft, there's no end to the opportunities out there,\" said actor Atiqa Odho in a Zoom interview with The Express Tribune.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since her first appearance on television in Sitara Aur Mehrunissa, Odho has managed to stay both relevant and graceful despite changing times and conventions. From her starring in various popular dramas such as Humsafar, Kaisi Teri Khudgarzi, and Pardes, to her upcoming international debut in Turkish drama Koyu Beyaz, the veteran keeps on surprising people with her commitment to acting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I've been extremely blessed to play roles onscreen that I've always dreamt of,\" relayed Odho while talking about her decades-long career in acting. \"A true actor is never satisfied with their performance; I still struggle to do my best and I think that is how it should be, otherwise, you become bored with yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to keep challenging herself, the Pyar Ke Sadqay actor also recounted how she tries her best to choose diverse roles on television, but the efforts remain futile. \"Sadly, repetition is not avoidable every time as uniquely written characters are lacking in scripts,\" Odho added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The road to international borders\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I felt like I was part of a historical change there,\" said Odho, while detailing her recent visit to Saudi Arabia. \"I didn't know what to expect, I was just told to visit a few places, but to my surprise, everything had changed. The entire region has adopted a more futuristic mindset.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, Odho met officials from the Saudi entertainment ministry and a committee to promote media and entertainment between the two countries. Her stay in the region was packed with beautiful experiences of visiting Makkah, Madina, Jeddah and Alkaaba Almushrafaa-the facility which manufactures Kiswa, the cloth that covers the Holy Kaaba.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, one aspect which caught her eye was the efforts made by the Saudi authorities to help women prosper in society. \"It was amazing how they are moving ahead and working towards putting women in all fields of work,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon being asked why she desires to promote Pakistani content in Saudi Arabia, Odho responded, \"We have a lot of Pakistanis living in Saudi Arabia and a huge indigenous following there that adores our dramas and films as the themes are culturally close to what they deem as acceptable in their society.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She further added, \"I feel that we have a massive opportunity to dub our projects and present them there, yet sadly we aren't taking any initiative. Our networks, producers, and creators should look towards forming joint ventures and focus on creating subtitles for the Arab community, it will be the beginning of a new era.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, Odho was elected as the chairperson of Actors Collective Trust, which aims to work for the betterment of the artist community in Pakistan. According to the actor, Saudi Arabia is just a pebble in an ocean as the picture in her mind is much bigger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Pakistanis love and view Turkish content on our television, why can't we show our serials on international platforms? The biggest example is Korean dramas, which have garnered a massive fanbase all around the world, especially among people who may not even understand the language. It's different now, Netflix and Amazon have helped change the mindset of the larger audience to digest different stories and languages,\" she shared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whether it's about love or family drama, If you've watched TV shows from Pakistan, India, and Turkey, the core of the stories are nearly identical, just different layers of dressings and appearances.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The gamble\n",
      "\n",
      "Odho also talked about her upcoming role in the Turkish drama Koyu Beyaz, which will premiere on TRT's new OTT platform. She revealed that although she will only make a guest appearance in the show, her experience working alongside producers in Turkey has made her more determined to drive Pakistani content to global audiences. \"Turkey has a brilliant film industry, as their focus has shifted to cater to foreign viewers too. The Legend of Maula Jatt is a huge inspiration for us, the film was promoted in foreign countries and earned revenue in international currency; those are the benchmarks for future creators in Pakistan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt the recent bans on films of web series are natural and part of the journey of growth in cinema. \"We are going through an evolution. Part of what we do in the entertainment industry is not just producing content but engaging people with different ideas and that takes time. Anytime you're trying to push for cultural change or opening up a more progressive attitude, you will have hiccups and roadblocks but you need to tackle them well,\" she explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If your definition of progressive is running around on television wearing a swimsuit, then that's not something even I find culturally acceptable. As they say, when in Rome, do as the Romans do. We are a diverse set of people and need to acknowledge everyone when we are conversing about evolving as a society and developing ideals.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before concluding the talk, she gave an example of valuable content, \"A few years ago I worked on a telefilm on breast cancer awareness and this was a time when people felt ashamed to even say the word, 'breast' loudly. As result, it led to many conversations about breast cancer and also helped reduce the stigma associated with it. So, rather than wasting our energy on irrelevant matters, we need to focus deeper on issues that can create an impact on our society, both in urban and rural areas.\"\n",

      "This year’s Aurat March Lahore’s theme was Feminism in Time of Crisis. The organisers encouraged posters and placards that highlighted concerns with respect to the same.

      "In light of the same, actor Iffat Omar took to the streets of Lahore on Wednesday to march for pay parity and equal rights for women. Her placard read: “Kaam pura tou ujrat aadhi kiun?” which roughly translates to, “Why pay half for a job well done?”\n",
      "\n",
      "A picture of Omar holding the placard was also shared on The Express Tribune’s Instagram. While the actor’s demand was neither discriminatory nor instigating hate speech, it was met with disapproval from several social media users, many of whom bashed Omar unprovoked. Among the spiteful comments, a woman had written, “Because you don’t know how to act.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, Omar lashed out, “If I don’t know how to act, then why do [they] chase me for work? I refuse to work! So literally, go to hell if you are ridiculing pay gap in Pakistan.” She then pointed out, “I don’t know how to act but even Mahira doesn’t get paid as much as Fawad.

      "Arooj Aftab received the Vilcek Prize ($50,000) for Creative Promise in Music for her “evocative songs and compositions that incorporate influences ranging from semi-classical Pakistani music and Urdu poetry to jazz harmonies and experimental music.” The platform that seeks to raise awareness about immigrant contributions to foster appreciation for the arts and sciences, announced on March 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "The foundation also published a video biography and in-depth profile of the artist titled, Arooj Aftab: My music is world-building, on the foundation's website. Brooklyn-based director Anais Blondet uploaded the short on her Instagram and captioned it, “Honoured to have worked with the incomparable Arooj Aftab on this portrait of her life and her stunning work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The short captures a day in the life of sorts of Arooj Aftab, as the Grammy winning artist wakes up to the scents and sounds around her and takes mental notes. She stirs tea, sips on it, and observes the world in her quiet little space. She narrates her story while at it. “My music is world-building,” she says. “There’s melodies and poetry and feelings swirling together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mohabbat crooner admits that “singing in Urdu is very important” to her, since it’s such a beautiful language. But one doesn’t need to understand the language to enjoy her music. “My question is always, ‘What does it sound like?’ Even if it’s a scent or an exchange of words or being in a particular place in time, how does it translate into music. That’s what I think about most of the time. So, it’s not like we’re composing a song, we’re building a world,” Arooj asserts.\n",
      "\n",
      "She goes on to narrate her life story strolling across Brooklyn, New York – her mecca of music making. “I was born in Saudi Arabia and spent 11 years there when my parents decided to move back to their hometown – Pakistan. Music was always a very important part of the house so I started playing guitar when I was 15-ish,” recalls Arooj. “That’s when I started singing and everybody was like, ‘Oh my God!’ I realised, my voice is taking the lead here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Udhero Na hitmaker reminisced moving to the United States in 2005 at the age of 20 to study music and music engineering at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. Berklee enabled Arooj to connect with musicians of many backgrounds and experiences, and to challenge herself to expand on how she works, as per her profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It always felt like such a singular journey until that moment,” she shares with Vilcek, noting how the ability to connect with other musicians, composers, and songwriters provided a wealth of opportunity to expand on her music in meaningful ways. The school’s focus on jazz and collaboration had a profound impact on Arooj. “Jazz is not just collaborative, it’s improvisational,” she says. “There’s a significant amount of improv in all of my music, and I purposely leave space for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The singer, who eventually moved to New York after completing her education, added in the short, \"New York is not like any other place on the planet. Everybody is radical, forward thinking. And as a creative person, you have access to collaborators that are super down to experiment,” she details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arooj’s process has been defined as collaborative -- opening a window into the language, cultural, and musical connections she has built along the way. “My music reflects my movement as an immigrant musician,” she says. “I can stay in motion without remaining ‘other,’ without losing sense of who I am,” adds the singer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When my album Vulture Prince was done and I listened to it as a whole, I was like, ‘I think I’ve done it! Here’s this music that I have been wanting to make, this beautiful, beautiful thing that didn’t exist, that should exist of respect and paying tribute to those who came before us.’ The love, the lack of love, the universe, all of these things came together in Vulture Prince. It’s something that I’m really proud of,” maintains Arooj, and rightly so.\n",
      "\n",

      "On shaky ground: construction in Pakistan\n",
      "When hiring a construction company to build the house of our dreams, we place our complete trust in their technical expertise, and not just to make our design dreams come true. We essentially trust local builders with our lives when hiring them to build us a home to live in. The majority of homeowners don’t have a clue about architectural design and building safety. For instance, we don’t know what column thickness is required to sustain the impact of a natural disaster like an earthquake. Instead of merely focusing on the appearance of our homes, we also need to ask whether the builders we hire do justice to the design layout and architecture of the building or whether they display knowledge of the basic engineering behind safe construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria have raised many questions about how the conditions of the infrastructure we have in Pakistan is safe enough, if our region faces a seismic catastrophe of similar magnitude or even an earthquake of low-intensity. The concern is pressing and calls for immediate action. According to the World Bank, since the earthquake of 2005, seismic risks in Pakistan have only increased. In its Fiscal Disaster Risk Assessment Options for Consideration the World Bank assesses that “if the 2005 earthquake were to occur today, it could cost nearly twice as much — $2.8 billion — in damages to residential properties alone.”\n",

      "“We [in Pakistan] are sitting on the verge of three plates: the Indo-Australian plate, the Arabian plate, and the Eurasian plate. It’s a miracle that we do not face any massive earthquakes because the conditions are not very favourable,” says Meritorious Professor at the University of Karachi’s Geography department Prof. Dr. Jamil H Kazmi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seismic zones are the areas where earthquakes tend to focus and can cause destruction if not planned wisely. Because earthquakes cannot be predicted and can cause massive destruction and loss of life, precaution is what can be focused on to lessen the danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We know the location of plates but predicting earthquakes and movements is not possible. The only solutions that we have are GPS insertion in plates that can alert the movements and, the best solution, intelligent structural designs,” adds Dr Kazmi.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main cause of death as seen by the disasters in the past is infrastructure damage, where people get buried under the wreckage. When creating a structure that will be subject to earthquake ground vibrations, structural analysis is essential to ensure that the facility will continue to fulfill its intended function even after an earthquake hits. This process is known as seismic design.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design faults\n",
      "\n",
      "Regions and even cities are defined by seismic zones on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 representing the most dangerous area that is at high risk to be hit by an earthquake. “Karachi is seismic Zone 2B,” explains Shazia Hussain, managing director of a private construction firm, “while Quetta, Haripur and other adjoining areas to these cities are zone 4. This is a parameter to understand the danger [of being hit by an earthquake].”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to her, Karachi is in moderate danger but the kind of construction this metropolis has seen in the last few years, especially in the old city areas, is a task for technical engineers to comprehend. “There are many factors that play a role in oversight [of construction],” says Hussain. “The factors that are ticking bombs are mainly the clients and their overlooking of the matter [building code requirements], where the authority approves ground-plus-two designs but clients make it ground-plus-four.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In an overpopulated metropolitan city like Karachi, stretched thin to meet the demands of the living situation, it is common to find constructions that disregard long-term safety requirements for the sake of quick money-making. This system can cause residents bigger losses than money. “In earthquakes, the lateral loads on the structure are not flexible but here clients don’t want to spend extra money for safety because adding flexible pads in the design can have additional cost,” says Hira Sadiq, an architect who runs her own design and construction firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Constructing a huge building in a small area is what can incur the most damage in case of an earthquake. Basic laws of physics can explain why. “When designing a building, we keep huge machinery in the basement or on ground levels while the common construction that we see around in the city is they make upper portions larger than the lower portions,” says Sadiq. The taller the building, the higher the chances of damage to it in case of any ground vibrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does the law say?\n",
      "\n",
      "Years after the British Raj, Pakistan continued to follow the building code established by the British. Additions were made as and when needed but the 2005 earthquake was a rude awakening for the country to come up with something to help in constructing better buildings in order to avoid another million people being affected by an earthquake in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In 2007, Pakistan Building Code was made which was revised in 2021. Before that the United Building Code and the International Building Code were used as references,” says a structural engineer at a government department on the basis of anonymity.\n",
      "\n",
      "He claims that most engineers design according to the given code of building and follow them religiously. “In General Musharraf’s era, when a sudden upsurge in high-rise buildings was seen, departments were strict enough not to leave any loopholes but these are mainly for over-the-carpet works. The main issue of wrongdoings is happening under the carpet and contractors who do not have any check and balance are building from their own understanding,” the engineer explains.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Sadiq has also pointed out, taking permission for two floors but adding more is a common practice across the country. Karachi has especially seen this trend over the last two decades. “In Delhi Colony, every plot is a mess waiting for a disaster to happen, with 100 square yards plot having a building of six to eight stories where at least 15 to16 families live,” says the structural engineer. The soil condition of the area doesn’t even allow the construction of more than two floors but the greed of constructors is more unshakeable. The situation is similar in many other areas such as Lyari, where virtually every plot now has a high rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the 2007 building code, many changes were implemented including increasing the column thickness from 6-8 inches to 8-12 inches. Yet where safety checks are implemented, quality control measures are not up to mark. For example, in construction, ready-made concrete mixes are used widely which do not pass quality control checks. Similarly, steel shattering is used which is of low quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amended bylaws also make sure that the supervisory body, the Sindh Building Control Authority, will appoint a random engineer to cross-check the structural design of a building so that the margin for error can be reduced. “The practice for cross-checking was very efficient but after some time, clients started complaining that cross-checking takes 15 days and they are running out of time. So now mostly engineers pay extra money or pay bribes to get the designs signed off without cross-checking,” says the structural engineer. The department also looks up extra money that can be generated from such practices. Clients just worry about approvals so all such safety prospects are ignored, he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conscientious design\n",
      "\n",
      "The Building Code has separate instructions for various sections, zones and regions to help design proper building accordingly. After that, cross-checking is what makes the infrastructure stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet despite all these bylaws, the buildings are old and need extra effort to be saved and there are separate ways to help out. “If we get any old structure which needs renovation, we highly recommend following zone-wise designs because rectification is not easy and for that an engineer needs working lines, which in the majority of the cases are not available,” the structural engineer explains adding that, in such cases, it is very common that buildings drift out or tilt. For that, shear walls should be constructed which can help in lifting the weight and keep the building from tilting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shear walls absorb the movements and counter the building. Similarly, soft stories should be built well so that they can sustain the weight of the upper floors,” he says. Soft stories are like parking floors that do not have brick walls but only columns as support. As is often seen in buildings in Karachi, the lower floors have parking and markets while the upper floors are used for residential purposes. The upper floors are more in weight and the mass of that is being carried by lower floors. “Soft stories create stiffness in the construction and that can be harmful in earthquakes. Obviously, increasing shear walls increases the cost as well but building safety is better than putting the lives of thousands in danger,” he stresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadiq explains adding that buildings that are constructed before the bylaws or have not been designed intelligently can also be saved with limited options. “Old buildings can be helped with buttressing or cross-bracing,” she adds. “These are like diagonal support that can help the structure stand still.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With bigger firms and construction companies working tirelessly on high rises and state-of-the-art building facilities, at the same time, small contractors are building in old city areas and densely populated areas with zero understanding of design and structure. “People are not educated and there is a lack of awareness even when the best engineers design because the labour class is not aware of the physics behind the construction and they only follow the [orders] of their seth [boss],” he laments. However, he claims that most are using good material and brilliant engineers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mentioning the common misconceptions about flawed buildings, he says that we think that high rises fall easily but what is more dangerous is a small building that is built in a small area. Giving an example of Avari Towers in Karachi, the structural engineer explains that the shape of it is very dangerous because the width is small but we can see the huge height.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other factors also include the support and surroundings. For example, in Defence Phase 7-ext, many buildings are constructed without any support from neighbouring buildings and they can be seen tilting. “Wind and seismic are two different criteria before design. Wind can play a role but mainly the soil and land area matters, in cases like Defense Phase 7. More buildings can help give support to tilting buildings but the main reason is constructing a heightened structure on a small area,” he says.\n",

      "Red zone country\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pakistan is a red zone for earthquakes,” says Chairperson of the Geology Department at the University of Karachi, Prof Dr Erum Bashir. “We are sitting on plate boundaries that are active. Obviously some cities are more dangerous but the Arabian Sea that touches the south of the country is also an active zone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She debunked the general misconception that we in Karachi are safe from earthquakes. Even lighter intensity jolts leave cracks in buildings as we have seen in the recent past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karachi, which has been a hub of lawless construction, has not seen any massive earthquake in the last five to six decades, “but there is the Rann of Kutch [which is situated on tectonic plates] and that can be activated at any time [causing a massive earthquake in Pakistan],” says Dr Bashir. “Chaman and its adjoining areas are situated on the fault lines and all its surrounding [areas] are also Zone 4 but Karachi has also felt tremors of a jolt after the 2005 earthquake. The intensity was low but even that can test all the construction that has been done in the last 20 years,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, there is not enough land available for development so the option of not constructing houses near tectonic plates is not viable. Therefore, people must be equipped with the right information to avoid safety hazards and be aware of disaster response, Dr Kazmi suggests. The best possible way is to educate people about earthquakes, how to react when one faces them, and where to hide. “Civil defense awareness is required from school level to parents, office workers, and everyone,” says Dr Kazmi.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in design costs have also impacted the construction industry. To understand the cost changes in the last 20 years, the cost of design per square foot has gone up from 8 pounds to 14 pounds. The importance of safe construction has also been understood by the developers in Pakistan and they have adjusted the cost of shear walls and soft stories; the cost has gone up by 50-60 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The need of the hour is to find alternative building materials, Dr Kazmi stresses, because block masonry has already caused a lot of damage to construction. “Local and wooden material helps in seismic zones and can also be environmentally friendly,” says Dr Kazmi. “The best alternative now is garbage bricks and they are used with local material,” he proposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "He adds that the European seismic scale, that is globally recognised, provides a guideline which helps in how to construct houses in different zones. If only that is followed then the situation can get better in the concrete jungle of Karachi.\n",
      "‘Could inferno be worse?’\n",
      "The Malayan Campaign which ended with the surrender of the British Indian and Australian Army troops in February 1942 was one of the worst military defeats of the Allies by the Japanese. Nearly 50,000 Commonwealth troops were captured or killed during the Japanese advance down the Malayan peninsula and 80,000 more prisoners were taken after the fall of Singapore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four percent of Allied prisoners of war (POWs) in Europe died in captivity, but in the Japanese POW Camps, the death rate of white prisoners was a horrifying 27 %. Worse still was the death rate of the Indian POWs who did not join the Indian National Army (INA). These unfortunate Indians paid a heavy price for remaining loyal to their oath under the most difficult and inhuman circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their number at the end of the Japanese campaign in Malaya varies between 50,000 and 60,000 of which approximately 40,000 joined the INA. Much has been written about the INA and the fate of those who served in its ranks, but there is little on record about the fate of those who remained loyal to their oath. Little evidence recorded after the war through eyewitness accounts and trials of the Japanese for war crimes, reveals that they were more harshly treated than others. Despite the large numbers involved, hardly any accounts from Indian POWs are known.\n",
      "\n",
      "After capturing Singapore, the Japanese launched attacks against British Burma, Australian-administered New Guinea and Papua, and the islands of the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia). Early in May 1943, the Japanese in Singapore formed “Indian Working Parties” from those who had resisted joining the INA. The largest group of 5000 (nine working parties) was sent to Rabaul in New Britain and 3,000 (six working parties) were sent to Wewak, in New Guinea. More were to follow later bringing the total to 10,000. With very few junior officers accustomed to take responsibility for large numbers of troops, the Indians suffered severely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their experiences as prisoners remains in their statements preserved in the Australian War Memorial’s Written Records collection, mostly compiled after their liberation. Some simply omit reference to those captured, and others dismiss three-and-a-half years of captivity in a few lines: “disease, privation, and inhuman cruelty took a heavy toll”. The history of the Frontier Force Rifles, for example, merely records that “the Sikhs and Dogras were sent to New Guinea, where most perished.” The history of the Baloch Regiment devotes just a page to the captivity endured by its 2/10 Battalion. It does, however, recognise that “The Indian Commissioned Officers, especially Captain Durrani, Lieutenant Mohammad Ismail and Abrar Hussain remained loyal all through and did much to keep all Indians loyal.” The history of the 3rd Cavalry (my father’s previous regiment), which surrendered at Singapore, has just two pages about their captivity and no mention of its soldiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "British official history omits any mention of them and in spite of emphasising the importance of loyalty as a central idea in the Indian Army, Philip Mason’s history of the Indian Army barely mentions these loyal prisoners ― though the INA is discussed at length.\n",
      "\n",
      "A rare first-person account is Eaten by the Japanese ― the memoir of John Crasta, a South Indian head clerk in the Indian Army Service Corps, who spent over three years in captivity. Most of the memoir is a clear and unsentimental account of slow bodily attrition caused by tremendous hard labour and starvation, being transported to the Island of New Britain off the northeast coast of New Guinea, with hundreds of fellow prisoners crammed into the hold of cargo ships. Describing the heat, suffocation and darkness, Crasta asks in his autobiography: “Could inferno be worse?” The camp was no better. Torrential rain, wet clothes and mosquitoes led to malaria and he lay shivering and helpless on the ground. “The thin cotton blanket given to me being inadequate to protect me from the cold, I waited for the sun to warm me. I would shiver like a leaf. Then, seized by fever, my body would turn as hot as fire ― I would become unconscious, then awake only to find myself perspiring. There was not a soul who could give [me] a sip of water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wewak, the largest Japanese air base on the mainland of New Guinea, suffered repeated bombing attacks by the US and Royal Australian Air Forces. The POW camp in a swampy area was encircled with barbed wire or high wooden fencing. On arrival, the prisoners had to hastily erect their own huts using bamboo and grass that offered little protection. During heavy rain, the camp flooded and they slept in water. Because no effective sanitary facilities could be constructed in the waterlogged camp, they fell ill. The few Indian medical officers in the working parties had no medical equipment and were sent to the harbour to unload ships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tojo, the prime minister and minister of war had instructed the head of the POW Management Office to “… be firm in your dealings with the prisoners and do not let them idle for even a day. It is your mission to strive to contribute to the execution of the Great East Asian War by fully utilising prisoners’ labour and skills to increase productivity.” Overzealous Japanese officers misconstrued these instructions and forced the POWs to perform inhuman labour. Japan was a signatory to the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, but no steps were taken to implement the pledge. Even among officers, it was common to treat international law lightly and to say “Japan has not ratified the Geneva Convention.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, like other camp commanders, Colonel Takano who was commanding the six Wewak working parties repeatedly called for the prisoners to work harder, beating men whom they thought were slow. Failure to comply with commands merited a beating, but very few guards spoke English. The Indians who had to call out their prisoner number in Japanese for the daily roll-call (Tenko) were compelled to learn the language. Escape attempts were rare because those who tried were executed in front of other prisoners and in some camps ten other prisoners were executed as a lesson for the others. During the six months that Colonel Takano was in command, about 400 out of the 3,000 Indian POWs died and about 300 became almost permanently disabled due to ulcers and tropical disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Rabaul like elsewhere, the Indian POWs worked 10-12 hours per day, but on days when the Americans launched heavy bombing raids, the POWs had to work 12 to 14 hours. Towards the end of their captivity, their diet consisted of small quantities of sweet potatoes and tapioca. They stole livestock and rice, but if caught or even suspected of stealing food, they were executed. As in most Pacific War campaigns, disease and starvation claimed more Japanese lives than enemy action. Most Japanese troops never came in contact with Allied forces. The maritime interdiction campaign against Japanese supply lines, the amphibious movements to outflank and bypass defensive positions coupled with an effective blockade by Allied naval forces were so effective, that many Japanese garrisons became isolated.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is claimed that 97% Japanese deaths in this campaign were from non-combat causes. To some extent, this would explain the suffering of the Indian POWs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a POW in Bougainville, (the largest island in the Solomon archipelago), Naik Clerk Gopal Pershad Jha, Ordnance Corps, recorded the daily scale of rice or wheat received. For the first five months, it was 400 grams per day, but within a year, it fell to 60 grams and finally the POWs were surviving on plants foraged from the jungle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Australians liberated over 6,300 Indian POWs with the majority from Rabaul (5,674) the most important defense base for the Japanese in the Southwest Pacific region. Australian units also recovered Indian POWs in both British and Dutch Borneo, but the remainder were mainly in the Netherlands Indies (390 in Morotai and 190 at Balikpapan) and 90 on Labuan in British Borneo. Based on an estimate of 10,000 Indian POWs transported to New Guinea and New Britain, the number of deaths was a staggering 40%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Australians were impressed by the martial commitment of the Indians. In May 1945, an Australian Battalion found a party of 14 Indians approaching its perimeter. Led by a havaldar, who formed his ragged and starving men into two ranks and reported to an Australian captain, “Havaldar [name] reporting with thirteen sepoys, Sir.” According to a witness, this was “a moment of great triumph” and “unforgettable” for those privileged to witness it.” A patrol rescued an emaciated Sikh from the jungle to be sent to the main base by boat after sufficient recovery. He asked to fire a few shots from a rifle. “It was touching,” the Australians recorded, “to see the way the poor chap placed his hands on the weapon once more.” He fired exactly as the musketry manual laid down and hit all of the bully beef tins set up as targets.” Similar reports by Australian soldiers in other areas suggest that the response was characteristic of liberated Indian prisoners who retained a sense of unit cohesion even after three and a half years of captivity. At Rabaul, liberated prisoners stood guard at a hut, a flagpole decorated its base with whitewashed rocks reading “1st Hyderabad” ― an Indian States Force battalion captured in Singapore. Nearby, at Kumuia Yama camp, within weeks of their liberation, prisoners formed a quarter guard, drilling with bamboo sticks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The liberated Indian POWs were brought from temporary camps in the islands to detachments of the Indian Army Mission of the Repatriation of Allied Prisoners of War and Internees (RAPWI). Its role was to document and re-equip liberated prisoners and dispatch them to India to rehabilitate both mentally and physically to the utmost extent in the time available.” The men were issued with Australian uniforms and kit, individual cooking utensils if caste rules required them, and Australian pay books as well as varying levels of pay according to their ranks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why were the Japanese so cruel with the POWs? Sarah Kovner’s Prisoners of the Empire, Inside Japanese POW Camps shows that much of the cruelty was at the policy planning level, less intentional than a result of negligence, incompetence, and irresponsibility that permeated all the way down. POW camps were administered in accordance with Japanese domestic regulations for handling prisoners. The non-commissioned officers (NCOs), soldiers and civilian aides in control of the prisoners knew nothing of the Geneva Convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horrid conditions, logistical difficulties, poor planning and negligence in the camps led to the high mortality rate. The Japanese were unprepared for the total collapse of the Allied forces at the initial stages of the war and the need to house tens of thousands of POWs. The permissive attitude toward corporal punishment is explained by the fact that this was prevalent in Japanese culture and their soldiers too were subjected to beatings. This, however, cannot absolve them from using Indian prisoners for target practice and bayoneting the survivors. Nor can it justify cases of cannibalism. In 1946, the Times of India carried a short item from Reuters that read, “Japanese Lieutenant Hisata Tomiyasu was found guilty of the murder of 14 Indian soldiers and of cannibalism at Wewak, New Guinea, in 1944 and has been sentenced to death by hanging.”\n",

      "What will happen to Imran Khan?\n",
      "My brief encounter with Imran Khan on February 15 was a reminder why millions of people continue to support him despite the many, some highly disturbing, events of the last ten months. In a deeply polarising political environment that if stretched a tad more would break like cheap elastic, Khan seems to have morphed into a national hero who is standing tall, metaphorically, against all institutional wrongs and state’s excesses. For a country riven with ideological and other differences, a sense of collective injustice acts as a unifying force. Pakistan, post-April 10, 2022, is a state in upheaval. Khan’s ouster was the first piece in a flimsy stack of dominoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The event at Khan’s house in Zaman Park, Lahore, was his meeting with foreign media correspondents and me. Before I proceed: I’m not a journalist but there is a large number of people who knowingly or in ignorance consider me a journalist because of my past work in media and my current column writing. Since 2018, I’ve been writing a weekly article for Gulf News, UAE. Despite my constant and vociferous and capitalised insistence that an opinion writer who merely contributes to a media house on a per-article honorarium is not a journalist, I’m loved and hated and respected and trolled and admired and despised—in unequal proportions—for my non-existent journalism. Heavens may fall if people were to accept the notion that I might be who I say I am—NOT A JOURNALIST.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Lahore’s Canal Road, parallel to Zaman Park, was a long row of tented booths, each one decorated with Pakistan’s flag, Tehreek-e-Insaf flag and banners displaying photos of Khan and a local, provincial or national PTI leader or group, “host” of that particular space. In that area, food is served, speeches are made, discussions are held, and comments are made to media. Each one of those present there is a supporter of Imran Khan. He is not in front of them, but they are there for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time in the history of Pakistan’s convoluted political landscape is an outpouring of support for a leader who is presently hailed as the sole sign of the power of democracy in Pakistan. In Khan — pitted against a ruling alliance of dozen-plus parties, propped up by the omnipotent Establishment — they see a lone crusader who is willing to fight to the end for supremacy of vote and power of the aam aadmi. In their united support, they have emerged as the emblem of one categorical message: they are with Khan, without any ifs and buts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside Khan’s home in Zaman Park, PTI workers and supporters form the “human chain” to protect Khan. In their words, Khan is their “red line”. Their stance is unambiguous: they respect the law, but they will not let the incumbent government arrest Khan on any allegation that is trumped up and lacks any legal validity. Their narrative is simple: more than sixty cases, including terrorism and sedition allegations, against Khan are nothing but State’s witch-hunt to persecute a leader who contrary to the misplaced assumptions of Those Who Shall Not Be Named and their latest “puppets” is the most popular leader of Pakistan, and who will win a clear majority in the general elections due this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "A voluntary assembly of supporters that appeared on the Canal Road leading to Khan’s home and the area around his home congregated weeks ago, and they don’t seem to be in any mood to leave. Pakistan is used to a long-standing culture of political rallies and electoral campaigns, but this spontaneous display of love and support for Khan is a unique phenomenon. Leaders frequently announce that workers and supporters should assemble in unity or in protest or to show solidarity for various reasons, but rarely is a large number seen outside a political rally. In the last ten months that has changed, but only for Imran Khan. On one tweet of one top leader of PTI, thousands of PTI supporters gather in Zaman Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "These PTI humans are not coerced. They are not paid any money. They are not brought to Zaman Park in hired vehicles. Their support is genuine, their support has longevity, their support is dil se.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the night between February 16-17, the same passion was seen in PTI workers and supporters when the news of Khan’s impending arrest was shared on social and electronic media. PTI workers and supporters work on the simple belief: Imran Khan is not guilty of any crime, and any effort to arrest him is a draconian measure to imprison him to stop him from demanding general elections, which according to political pundits, PTI is all set to win.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children, teenagers, young men and women, the underprivileged and the wealthy, homemakers and professional women, the elderly and the ailing, the middle aged and the middle class, students and businessmen, retired faujis, the illiterate and the highly educated, the progressive and the conservative — Khan’s supporters do not have a uniform look, but they are all united under one banner. The flag of Pakistan. No longer is the struggle merely for Khan’s return to power. For them, the fight is now for the survival of Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 9, 2022, Pakistan Democratic Movement’s orchestrated ouster of Khan was a thinly veiled coup through a vote of no confidence, and it set a series of events that elicited an unprecedented public reaction. In the backdrop of the ugly history of the military coup against Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and his judicial assassination, and dismissals of elected prime ministers (late Benazir Bhutto twice, Nawaz Sharif thrice, and Yousaf Raza Gillani once), the removal of another elected prime minister was the wake-up call for a mostly apathetic nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan’s ouster was a shocking reminder that not much had changed in the power dynamics of Pakistan despite the Establishment’s constant reassurances of non-interference in civilian matters, and the longstanding avowals of two main political parties, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Pakistan People’s Party, to uphold democratic values, having been burnt too many times in their attainment and retaining of power with the tacit or blatant support of non-civilian powers. Reasons varied but the ousters bore terrifying similarities. What they did to Khan was a repeat performance of what had happened to them too many times. Pakistan was shocked at their jubilation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ouster, purportedly, had a three-point agenda: re-nomination of COAS Bajwa in November 2022, dismissal of cases against the top leadership of PML-N and PPP, and creation of a favourable electoral mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation and other governance weaknesses of the PTI government in March 2022 were the reasons used as justification for staging a vote of no-confidence against Khan’s government in April 2022. At that time, the general view across Punjab, Pakistan’s largest electorate, and other parts of the country was of disillusionment. Khan’s voters were disheartened, and Khan’s detractors were loud in their we-knew-he-would-not-be-good-for-Pakistan. If Khan’s government had been “allowed” to complete its five-year term, ending in August 2023, the mainstream consensus was that he would not return to power in 2023. PTI government’s inability to curb inflation was cited as its worst failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters on February 15, 2023, reported: “The consumer price index rose 27.5% year-on-year in January, its highest in nearly half a century.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters on February 15, 2023, also reported: “Inflation in Pakistan could average 33% in the first half of 2023 before trending lower, and a bailout from the International Monetary Fund alone is unlikely to put the economy back on track, a senior economist with Moody's Analytics told Reuters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakistan changed in ways, perceptible and imperceptible, after Khan’s ouster on April 9, 2022. PTI’s parliamentarians resigned from the National Assembly. (For ten months Pakistan’s parliament has been operational with a non-existent opposition, putting a huge question mark on the veracity and viability of all its actions.). Protests were seen across Pakistan. Khan’s vote bank rallied. These who voted for him and were uncertain of voting for him again became unambivalent. Those who had never voted for him became his supporters. Khan’s first protest rally in Peshawar on April 13, 2022 had a huge attendance. PTI held sixty rallies across Pakistan. Every rally of Khan in 2022 had a number that broke PTI’s own records of gigantic participation.\n",
      "\n",
      "On November 3, 2022, Khan was wounded in an assassination attempt at Wazirabad’s Allah­wala Chowk during his “Haqeeqi Azadi” march to Islamabad. PTI worker Moazzam Gondal was killed while trying to catch the hitman who had shot at Khan’s container. Thirteen PTI leaders were injured. Pakistan went into a state of shock and grief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three months later, Khan is still in the process of recuperation, a brace on his right leg and instructions from his medical team to rest until complete healing of his wounds. When I saw him on February 15, he seemed to be in high spirits despite his limited movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "On February 16, Dawn reported: “A Lahore High Court division bench on Thursday dismissed for non-prosecution a petition of PTI chairman Imran Khan seeking protective bail in a criminal case by the Islamabad police, whereas a single bench allowed him an opportunity to appear on Monday in another petition of bail in a similar case.”\n",

      "Populism over prudence\n",
      "The rise of populism in recent years has had a profound impact on economic decision-making in third world countries. Populist politicians, who champion the cause of ordinary people against the elite, have gained a strong following among the masses and have been successful in influencing economic policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the World Bank Doing Business report, countries that adopt a populist approach to economics often rank lower in ease of doing business compared to other countries in the region. This is due to the perception that these countries are less predictable and less supportive of private enterprise, which discourages investment and entrepreneurship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Statistics provide evidence of the negative impact of populist approach on economic decision-making in third world countries. For example, in the last decade, several Latin American countries that adopted a populist approach to economics have experienced slower economic growth compared to other countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to data from the World Bank, the average annual economic growth rate in Latin America was 2.5% between 2010 and 2019, compared to 3.7% in East Asia and the Pacific. Similarly, countries in Latin America also had a higher rate of inflation compared to other regions, with an average inflation rate of 8.3% compared to 4% in East Asia and the Pacific.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wealth distribution and fiscal discipline\n",
      "\n",
      "The most notable aspect of populist approach to economics is its focus on distribution of wealth. Populist politicians often promise to reduce income inequality by redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor. This is achieved through various means, including taxes, subsidies, and social welfare programmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although these measures may bring short-term benefits to the poor, they often have a negative impact on the economy as a whole. For example, high taxes on the rich may discourage investment and entrepreneurship, leading to a reduction in job opportunities and economic growth. Subsidies for certain sectors or industries can also distort the market, leading to inefficiencies and hindering long-term economic development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another aspect of populist approach to economics is its disregard for fiscal discipline which is the balance between revenues and expenditure of a government. Populist politicians often promise to increase government spending on various programmes and services, such as health, education and infrastructure. This is done to appease the masses and win their support. However, this approach is often unsustainable and leads to an increase in government debt and a worsening of the fiscal deficit. In the long run, this can result in economic instability and a reduction in economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prioritising public spending\n",
      "\n",
      "The populist approach to economics has a strong focus on addressing income inequality, a problem that has plagued many developing countries for decades. This approach aims to bridge the wealth gap between the rich and the poor by implementing various measures, such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programmes, which redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "This helps to improve the living standards of the poor and reduce poverty, and can serve as a powerful tool in the fight against poverty and social exclusion. By prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable members of society, the populist approach seeks to create a more equitable and just society, where all citizens have equal access to the benefits of economic growth. The implementation of this approach has the potential to bring positive change to the lives of millions of people who struggle to make ends meet, and is a crucial step towards creating a fairer and more prosperous society.\n",
      "\n",
      "The populist approach to economics places a strong emphasis on addressing the needs of the public, by prioritising spending on essential services such as health, education and infrastructure. This approach seeks to improve the quality of life for ordinary citizens and create a more prosperous society by providing access to critical services that are crucial to individual and collective well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "By investing in these areas, the populist approach helps to create a stronger foundation for economic growth, by providing the necessary support to individuals and communities. By prioritising public spending on essential services, the populist approach can be a key driver of sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the long run. The implementation of this approach has the potential to bring real and tangible benefits to people's lives, and can help to create a more equitable and just society.\n",
      "\n",
      "The political landscape and populism\n",
      "\n",
      "The populist approach to economics can have a significant impact on the political landscape by helping to win the support of the masses and increase political stability. This is because populist politicians often make promises to address the concerns of ordinary citizens and improve their living standards by implementing policies that prioritise the needs of the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "The focus on addressing the economic needs of the people, combined with a willingness to take bold and decisive action, can help populist politicians to build broad-based support among the electorate. The success of populist approach in addressing the concerns of ordinary citizens can help to increase political stability, by reducing public discontent and creating a more supportive political environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can have far-reaching benefits for both the economy and society as a whole, and can help to create a more prosperous and inclusive future for all citizens. The populist approach encourages social justice by promoting fairness and equality, and by ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared fairly among all citizens. This helps to create a more stable and sustainable society, by reducing social unrest and promoting greater economic and political stability. The implementation of this approach can have far-reaching benefits for society as a whole, by promoting greater social justice and equality and helping to create a fairer and more prosperous future for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weighing the long-term effects\n",
      "\n",
      "The populist approach to economics, which emphasises addressing the needs of the public and increasing government spending, can sometimes result in reduced fiscal discipline. Increased government spending can result in a worsening of the fiscal deficit and an increase in government debt, which can have negative consequences for the economy. This can lead to economic instability as the government struggles to manage its finances and fund essential services.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the long run, reduced fiscal discipline and increased government debt can slow economic growth, as the government's ability to invest in key areas such as education, health, and infrastructure is diminished. The absence of fiscal discipline can also impact the confidence of investors and create uncertainty, further hindering economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the populist approach can have positive impacts on the economy in the short term, its failure to address the issue of reduced fiscal discipline can limit its effectiveness in the long run and negatively impact economic stability and growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Market distortions and populism\n",
      "\n",
      "The populist approach to economics, which aims to address public needs and reduce income inequality, can sometimes result in market distortions. The use of subsidies and other forms of intervention in the market can create inefficiencies and hamper long-term economic development. Subsidies can reduce the motivation for businesses to become more efficient and productive as they are cushioned from the effects of market forces. This can result in a lack of competition and innovation, hindering the growth of the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the provision of subsidies can create an environment of dependence, where businesses become reliant on government support and are less likely to invest in research and development. The populist approach may also result in the creation of monopolies and oligopolies, as companies with political connections benefit from preferential treatment, stifling competition and hindering economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the populist approach has the potential to address social and economic inequalities, its impact on the market can undermine its effectiveness and limit the potential for long-term economic growth and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "High taxes and low investment\n",
      "\n",
      "The populist approach to economics, which focuses on redistributing wealth and addressing the needs of the public, can sometimes have a negative impact on investment and entrepreneurship. The implementation of high taxes on the rich and the absence of a predictable business environment can discourage investment and entrepreneurship, leading to a reduction in job opportunities and economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "High taxes can reduce the incentive for entrepreneurs and investors to take risks and start new businesses as they face a greater burden of taxation. Additionally, a lack of predictability in the business environment can create uncertainty for investors and entrepreneurs, who may be less likely to invest in new ventures if they do not have a clear understanding of the rules and regulations that will apply to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can result in a reduction of capital flows and a slowdown in job creation, stifling economic growth and hindering long-term development. While the populist approach may help to reduce income inequality and address public needs, its impact on investment and entrepreneurship can limit its effectiveness in promoting sustainable economic growth and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-term and short-term policies\n",
      "\n",
      "The populist approach to economics, while aiming to address immediate concerns of the public, can sometimes have a short-sighted focus, prioritising short-term benefits over long-term consequences. This mindset can result in unsustainable economic policies that may provide temporary relief but cause harm to the economy in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, policies that increase government spending and reduce taxes in the short term may boost consumer spending and stimulate the economy, but can also lead to a larger fiscal deficit and higher levels of debt in the long term. This can limit the government's ability to invest in essential services and infrastructure and hinder future economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, policies that subsidise certain industries or products may reduce the cost of living in the short term, but can create inefficiencies and distort market forces, hindering long-term development. The short-term focus of the populist approach can lead to a cycle of economic boom and bust, reducing economic stability and impeding progress towards sustainable growth and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "A balancing act\n",
      "\n",
      "The challenge for policymakers is to balance these competing interests and find a path that promotes sustainable economic growth, reduces poverty and inequality, and improves the quality of life for all citizens. It is important to understand that while populist measures can provide immediate relief to certain groups, they may not be sustainable in the long term and may lead to unintended consequences that can harm the economy and society as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it can help to address inequality and improve the living standards of the poor, it can also lead to economic instability and reduced economic growth in the long run. It is important to strike a balance between addressing public needs and promoting sustainable economic growth and development.\n",

Its decision to slap Section 144 to push back PTI workers — who were out to kick-start their election campaign, which resulted in the killing of a party supporter allegedly in police custody — and the Aurat March all made it chaotic. There was utter confusion as police were on a witch-hunt, and the administration was shying behind the excuse that it was warranted in public interest. Telecast scenes of policemen damaging vehicles of the PTI rally made the equation too kinetic and electrifying. But as semblance prevailed, the PTI called off its campaign for the day, and tried playing to the gallery by questioning the sincerity of the interim government in holding the polls in Punjab, which have already been scheduled for April 30.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is some serious thinking business needed by the political parties, and the caretakers in the province, to resolve whether the constitutional mandatory elections in the province will be held under what scenario. The retreat of the Punjab government by taking back Section 144, which was earlier imposed for seven days, and the relief that the PTI chairman got from the court of law, wherein he was excused from personally appearing in a case, have scaled down the tension. This is a much-desired relief, and the need of the hour is to ensure that law and order is maintained, and due political space is provided to all political parties in the run for electioneering. This is, in fact, the primary duty of the interim setup under Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi, and he and his cabinet are liable to the dictates of the constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question now is what’s ahead? The PTI’s recourse to talk it out with the Election Commission, and knock at the superior judiciary’s door, to realise its fundamental right of going to the polls is most welcome. It has to also ensure that its support does not turn into a clash of interests, and this is where the acumen of leadership counts. Let there be no repeat of May 25 and March 8 fissures on the streets of Punjab.\n",

      "Karachi: no mayor yet\n",
      "Local government activities in the country’s largest city remain paralysed because of the failure to hold the remaining elections, announce results on a few seats, or even attempt to name a mayor. It is already clear from the results so far that no single party will have absolute power, as the two biggest parties will fall short of the 50% mark even if they win all of the remaining seats. Meanwhile, the PTI has won enough UCs to throw an additional spanner into the works, if it so chooses, because its support will likely determine who becomes mayor. Although the PPP is the largest party so far with 84 Union Councils (UCs), and pundits believe it will also win most of the remaining open and unannounced seats, the PTI and its 40 UCs could back a candidate from its historical ally, the JI, which has 82 UCs, just to show up the PPP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the PTI could otherwise leverage its kingmaker status with the PPP, although this appears less likely, given the divide between the two parties’ top leaders at national level. But politicking aside, several local government issues have been exasperated in recent months because of the incessant delays in the polls and subsequent delays in the announcement of results. It is indeed unfortunate that the JI needed to seek high court intervention to get polls held in some UCs. However, it is also problematic that the religious party is slinging rigging and favouritism claims without any strong evidence, because the last thing Karachi needs is further erosion of citizens’ faith in the ability of their elected officials to perform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, despite the PPP’s lack of urgency to activate the local government, it is to their credit that they have acknowledged the JI’s victories. But the PPP still needs to prove that it wants to govern, rather than rule, and that will only happen if it supports efforts to complete polling, including by joining hands with the JI to demand the election commission pick up its work pace.\n",

      "Female-centred transport\n",
      "There is another good news for the female commuters of Karachi. After the first ever women-only bus service launched by the Sindh government, a private transport company has initiated the launch of a new “women-driven motorbike service” in the bustling city. Through this, the company’s female clientele will have access to an affordable, safe and reliable means of transport amid rising inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ultimate goal is to create a society where females no longer have to rely on their parents or spouses to commute, and can fearlessly travel across the city for work or leisure. Such projects are primarily important to uplift and empower women by making them more independent. For majority of women, commuting through traditional means can be a traumatic experience as countless instances of harassment occur every day, making it highly unsafe. Therefore, until society learns how to treat and respect women, female-only services are necessary to mitigate the daily challenges they face. Apart from this, the initiative will help provide females with jobs during times of severe economic distress. By signing up as a female bike captain, they can earn a good sum of money in a convenient way every month. Financial independence is the most important step towards empowerment. The initiative will also help break stereotypes and gender roles that women cannot and should not drive. Through this women-centred approach, more women will be urged to learn how to ride bikes and cars — an important modern-day skill — and this will slowly help normalise the idea of female drivers in society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Women must now take charge of this and build their own social community to encourage those from less-privileged background to opt for such services. The stronger their community the more they can help empower and protect each other. It is hoped that the same project is extended to other cities across the country.\n",

      "Reimagine, not derail, Pakistan\n",
      "A recent tweet by veteran journalist Abbas Nasir points towards a tendency that refuses to go away. He says: “Ever since Miftah Ismail started to raise questions about the NFC award, the glue that binds the federation together, I am a bit concerned about where he will take us.” Technocrats have a problem. They think they have the economic solutions but the politicians do not have the will to execute. A technocratic setup backed up by brute authority to implement long-delayed, hard decisions is seen as the way forward. Miftah Ismail, one had thought, was a technocrat who had been groomed enough in politics to appreciate that economic solutions have to be negotiated between the stakeholders for their long-term sustainability. But his utterances on the 7th NFC and provincial autonomy raise doubts about real intentions behind the Reimagine Pakistan agenda. If reimagining means reopening the settled issues rather than resolving the neglected issues, the agenda might derail Pakistan. Within two decades of the country’s emergence, the failure to negotiate in the political arena resulted in the 1971 catastrophe. Political engagement in 1973 and in 2010 has ensured five decades of stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Imran Khan and his handlers, Miftah thinks that the federal fiscal woes are the result of the larger share of resources passed on to the provinces under the 7th NFC. Far from it. The federal government had committed to increase the tax to GDP ratio to 15% at the time of signing up on the 7th NFC. It miserably failed to do that. Tax to GDP ratio of federally collected taxes has actually declined from 9.7% in FY2010 to 9.2% in FY22. On the other hand, the provincial taxes have increased from 0.3% to 0.9% of GDP. The overall tax to GDP ratio remains low at 10.1%. Federal spending only declined from 13.6% of GDP in FY10 to 13.1% in FY22. In keeping with the significant reduction in the number of federal subjects following the 18th amendment, the reduction in the federal spending should have been much more.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that the provinces are not fully exploiting the potential of their own sources of revenue. The increase noted above has come mainly from the GST on services, a new source due to the 18 amendment. Agricultural income falling in their domain remains massively undertaxed. The collection is no more than a few billion rupees. Property tax, which is the third largest tax in other countries, yields just a little more than the agricultural income. Property tax truly belongs to the local governments. Despite Article 140A included under the 18th Amendment to ensure elected local governments for effective service delivery, the provincial governments have shied from transferring power and responsibility to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miftah is right in saying that “I want true federalism & powers devolved to local levels, so that power isn’t concentrated in provincial capitals either. But where I want provinces to have authority, I want them to have responsibility to raise a larger part of their own revenues.” But they have nothing to do with a crisis created by the federal government’s gross economic mismanagement. In fact, they suffer as a result of the budgetary surpluses forced on them by the federal government. In the present crisis, the immediate action for the federal government is to reduce expenditures and tax expenditures. But it has chosen the tax side and the measures taken are the usual pack of imposing pricking pain on the existing tax payers. Reimagining tax structure including a single tax authority should address Miftah’s concern.\n",

      "Cooperate regionally to curb air pollution\n",
      "The smog season has now ended in in major South Asian cities such as Lahore and New Delhi. But like the other seasons, the now all too familiar murky smog will return next winter as pollution will once again become trapped into the lower atmosphere due to temperature inversion. As South Asia is home to 9 of the world’s 10 cities suffering from worst air pollution, it is time to take concrete steps to contend with this widespread problem which is wreaking havoc on the health of millions of people, and has many related adverse impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Bank’s latest report ‘Striving for clean air: Air pollution and public health in South Asia’ highlights how air pollution in the region is not relegated to specific localities within the tidy confines of national boundaries. Instead, this polluted air is a transboundary problem for the entire region. The report estimates that over half of the air pollution in South Asian cities originates elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several other experts have pointed out that air pollution travels in a complicated pattern which crosses varied man-made boundaries, depending on wind patterns and a range of other climate-related factors. The World Bank points out how nearly a quarter of fine particulate matter that residents of Patna in India are exposed to originates in a neighbouring state. In other seriously polluted cities, such as Colombo, Dhaka and Kathmandu, merely a third of air pollution is being emitted within these cities. On average, 30% of the air pollution in polluted Bangladeshi cities like Dhaka and Chittagong can be traced to be coming in from India. Similarly, 30% of air pollution in Indian Punjab is estimated to be coming in from the Pakistani side. But when wind patterns change, the air pollution in cities like Lahore also spikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Bank report has identified half a dozen major airsheds in South Asia where air quality interdependence is particularly high. One such airshed includes both the Pakistani and Indian sides of the Punjab. Southern Pakistan, Western Afghanistan and Eastern Iran comprise another airshed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources of air pollution in the broader region include industrial emissions, the use of bad quality fuel, unchecked automobile emissions, burning of solid fuel such as wood for cooking and heating, and the operation of smaller industries such as brick kilns. The ineffective disposal of municipal waste, including burning of garbage, also emits significant hazardous fumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "South Asian countries are trying to varying degrees to implement emission standards for vehicles, import better quality fuel, and even require power plants and industrial units to use air filters for larger industrial boilers. To achieve more progress, implementation of these efforts will need to become more robust. However, to create more significant difference all regional countries will have to undertake coordinated pollution control measures. For instance, substituting excessively costly measures at hotspots by more cost-effective measures in areas upwind of hotspots is one cost saving strategy which cooperation can enable. Operationalising such efforts will also require significant effort focusing not only on evident polluters such as industry or the transport sector at large, but on curbing air emission in small manufacturing, and enabling poorer households to use cleaner cookstoves instead of coal or wood. Lessening release of secondary particulate matter through effective fertiliser and manure management and dealing with municipal waste in a more environmentally friendly manner could also make a significant contribution to cleaning up the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Bank rightly argues that the direct economic gains of better air quality far exceed the cost of measures needed to reduce air pollution. The World Bank would probably be willing to offer more loans to implement market-driven means to contend with regional pollution. Ideally, entities like the World Bank should be giving out grants instead of providing more loans to address pollution-related problems, especially those emerging from the inability of international donors to integrate environmental sustainability into their growth-obsessed development strategies.\n",

      "I hate to admit but we grew up believing that politics was a dirty game. Anyone who massaged or manipulated his way up the ladder was popularly abhorred and ridiculed. Submission to authority to win favours was not let to slide by easily among fighter pilots. If it has now changed, I wouldn’t know. It just might have because there were signs already of influences slowly diluting the ethos that made the air force culture unique. And we prided in it. Perhaps we were naïve, because the real world needed attributes not usually found in fighter cockpits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being a fighter pilot was an onerous undertaking, of being a worthy part of the collective and a constant battle to meet up and excel beyond expected standards. If we did well on a certain day, we put our collars up a bit higher and were it below par the crestfallen face told that story the entire day. But then you sprang back up to prove your frenemy wrong. In my 33 years of active, operational service, politics per se, as is practised on our national scene, was never even a moment’s concern in our work, nor discussed. Collectively, as a nation, yes — when one watched the proverbial 9’O Clock News or read the Papers, (some of us did) — there was a lurking fear of which way were we heading. And if one carried the bug for reading — which changed taste as we grew along — we could make relative comparisons with the rest of the world and slowly but surely deepen our sense of engagement and inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a generation we came of age in the early 1970s. I was part of the 1971 war as a 19-year-old with duties compatible with my service experience. I was also the generation who had Bengali friends, some very close. We saw it coming in our shenanigans, politically manipulated and militarily misguided, and in the eyes of our East Pakistani friends where recognition was soon replaced with deep hatred. And yet, we thought this too shall pass. Friends will revert to being friends. They did not, and then separated to never return. We cried, literally, not because we were young and naïve but because we had suffered the biggest pang in one’s life, of losing a part, of being dismembered, of never feeling whole again. Yet, we stood up and rebuilt and fell in love again with what was now the home and served it to our very best at the peril of our lives if it came to it. It did on more than one occasion, at various points in our professional career and at different times of our lives, always beckoning the very best out of us to never fail the expectations of who we were, who we thought we were and what was expected of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all this there were the vibrant and dynamic times of ZAB — some mercurial and inspiring, some fascist and egomaniacal. The world was changing and so had Pakistan. It was impossible not to be influenced by the times if you read and reflected and your heart felt a pang. Zia’s was a dampener. In some ways palliative and soothing frayed emotions triggered by ZAB’s unpredictability and whimsical temper and some ways deadening because suddenly the light was all gone. We were back to sedate even if predictable existence. The wars and the cultural shocks ensued. We haven’t looked back since.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 90s brought a period of restraint in national affairs as the military smarted from time under Zia. He was persistently vilified as a dictator especially since he also carried the blemish of hanging Bhutto. That blot never washed. If politics changed after Zia, it can be related to the defiance which his rather tyrannical tenure had induced among those who gave it a different meaning. Ideological mooring now anchored in defying nation’s military, rightly or wrongly. Such resort gave rise to heroic figures slowly turning politics into a tribal, familial and exploitative corporate. We have failed to recover from such misplaced nuance of politics losing the meaning of why politics is, and its role in making democracy relevant. Unfortunately, national politics has not been able to break out of its restrictive reclassification limiting its essence in popular perception to defiance alone against the military than a means to execute governance in the interest of the people. It is thus slowly losing its relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 90s, under Article 58(2)(b), it was possible to dismiss an elected Assembly by the President and his two cohorts, the CJ and the army chief, if they found a sitting Prime Minister acting differently. Both Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif were removed twice each during the decade. Zia had introduced the amendment in the constitution which made the clause a hanging sword on all prime ministers. The clause was eliminated by Nawaz Sharif in a slew of amendments in 1997 securing the Assembly and his own position from draconian elimination. But, when he tended to now use his uncontested power to sack the sitting army chief to stamp his authority, Musharraf resorted to the only possible means of overthrowing a government, with a coup howsoever unsavory. Laws were changed to condone his action. Many thought 58(2)(b) was a shield from martial laws and when removed it paved the way for one. Another CJ, in another time, found Musharraf guilty of usurping power, some say to avenge his treatment at Musharraf’s hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Bajwa, faced with another challenge from Nawaz Sharif in the carry-over case of Dawn Leaks and haranguing of Musharraf, a former army chief, devised what was subsequently termed a Bajwa Doctrine. Hardly a doctrine, it was essentially a via media to guide democracy by keeping the dynasties of Sharifs and Bhuttos — who had till then earned quite a notoriety — out and bet on a new horse. The objective to move the country forward under an honest, hardworking and sincere leader of integrity — who could also be beholden to the military for his elevation — may have been clever but backfired badly. Politics, as dirty as it was, marred and maligned those who got sucked in by its enamour. Bajwa left the army yet again smarting with lessons relearnt.\n",
      "\n",
      "What began in 1988, a period of ‘chaperoned democracy’, has stayed on under one guise or another forever shaping the politics of this country. The army, judiciary and the politicians are thus embroiled in a system in which each seeks assurance of the other to function and govern even passably. The bureaucracy, as per normal, assists as a humble servant. The ‘system’ thus prevails. The mould will only be broken when a more assured, capable, statesman of vision and integrity ever takes the helm. Till then it remains the system alone that will work even if it creaks under its own weight.\n",

      "I switched to Microsoft Edge from Google Chrome, and I liked it\n",
      "After using Google Chrome for most of my years, the recent integration of AI with the Bing search engine and the Edge browser tempted me to switch to the new browser that is making news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprisingly, Edge does seem to be the better browser than Chrome, with far better features to help you work, multitask and organise projects effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Switching to Microsoft Edge was like trying out a new pair of shoes, slightly uncomfortable at first, but the more you use it, the more comfortable you get with all the services and features. Most importantly, the switch from Chrome was seamlessly easy, as Edge synced all of my data from Chrome so I could begin work immediately without having to reopen regular tabs and re-login to accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few features I noted to be significant when comparing the experiences of the two browsers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Design\n",
      "\n",
      "The new Edge browser has a simple design pretty much like Google Chrome, so the move will not seem awkward and out of place. The browser does, however, let you place your tabs vertically on the left side for a different experience and convenience. I, however, preferred to minimize the change for an effortless move, and retained the horizontal tabs at the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Features\n",
      "\n",
      "The features are the primary reason why you should move to Edge browser, many of which are unavailable on Chrome. The right click with your mouse opens up a range of options for the particular webpage. The browser lets you group certain tabs together in a collection so that you can effortlessly move between different tabs for work or personal research. Moreover, the Edge Bar floats around the edge of the laptop’s display for a quick look into news and weather or other Edge features.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Microsoft browser has a built-in AI assistant like Grammarly to keep your writing grammatically correct on any site. Interestingly, Edge offers a Read Aloud feature, that reads out the webpage opened for you, especially when you’re too lazy to read lengthy information online. Another cool feature of the browser is its ability to screen capture a webpage easily, along with tools to crop or paint on the picture, which can either be shared, saved to a local device, or copied to clipboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The webpage, however, cannot be cast to other devices using ChromeCast, unlike Google Chrome. Microsoft Edge uses Miracast and DNLA protocols for this service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Syncing\n",
      "\n",
      "While Edge easily synced most data from Google Chrome like favourite webpages, login information, and history, it cannot sync themes, addresses, and phone number information. User data can however easily be transferred between the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security and Privacy\n",
      "\n",
      "Edge has better privacy settings features than Chrome, like blocking trackers from sites you’ve visited and those you haven’t, reducing the odds of your personal information being shared on the net. The browser also uses Microsoft Defender SmartScreen against malicious attacks from viruses on sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bing Vs Google\n",
      "\n",
      "While Bing’s AI chat is still only available to a limited few, Microsoft has opened applications for early access to some users and I gained access to the ChatGPT rival. The Bing Chat feature works pretty much as a search engine providing quick precise answers from the web, along with ChatGPT-style generated content. While many have already contested the information provided by Bing Chat before, I found it to be a useful addition to web searching. Time will, however, tell how authentic the information provided is.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Bing’s interface makes my day with beautiful photographic pictures and provides me with an essential overview of everything on a board. It’s like opening up the Windows Start Menu for news and information of the day. While the search results are pretty similar to Google Search, Bing has different features along with images, videos, translate, news, chats, etc, while the Chat feature can narrow down search results and write content for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft Edge is a good change from Google Chrome, especially with the additional features that aren’t available on the latter browser. Moreover, browsing is more convenient and allows for seamless switching between tabs and different projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you haven’t given Edge a try, it's time to do so, as Microsoft strives to add more AI services into the browser for a better user experience, and Google seems to be falling a bit behind in the global AI race.\n",
      "OpenAI to enable more customizations for enterprise, individual\n",
      "OpenAI, the creator of the buzzy chatbot ChatGPT, will release tools to give users more control over the generative AI system, while improving the models for both general and specific use cases, its CEO Sam Altman said Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking to investors at a Morgan Stanley conference, Altman said the AI company will focus on building a platform that sells APIs to others and creates killer apps like ChatGPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since its launch in November, ChatGPT's popularity has surged as traffic to the site hit more than 1 billion visits, up from 616 million in January, according to Similarweb estimates. OpenAI has launched a subscription tier of ChatGPT where users can pay $20 per month for more reliable services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Microsoft-backed company is working with enterprise clients to train its models in particular domains and has effectively reduced hallucinations, incidents when an AI system confidently gives a response that is factually incorrect, according to Altman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Management consultancy Bain & Company, has struck a global services partnership with OpenAI, enabling Bain to embed AI in its client operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enterprises that work with OpenAI can use their data and make a copy of the model to alleviate data safety concerns. Coca-Cola, for example, is working with OpenAI and Bain to use OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALL-E platforms to create personalized ad copy, images, and messaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "Altman, a veteran entrepreneur and investor, said the company should be valued by investors as a firm to achieve the goal of general artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Individual users should also have more control over how the AI works, Altman added. The company said last month it is developing an upgrade to its chatbot that users can customize to address concerns about bias in artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll launch more things soon that give users additional control on the system to behave this way or that way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Altman acknowledges the AI system cannot achieve 100% accuracy, and he said he expects applications including AI doctors and AI lawyers to emerge on people's phones soon.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We're exploring a standalone decentralized social network for sharing text updates. We believe there's an opportunity for a separate space where creators and public figures can share timely updates about their interests,\" a Meta spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.\n",

      "\n",
      "While Twitter and Facebook are controlled by one authority - a company - decentralized platforms such as Mastodon are installed on thousands of computer servers, largely run by volunteer administrators who join their systems together in a federation.\n",

      "Family still waiting for late athlete Shahida’s body\n",
      "“It has been a huge loss for those who thought of Shahida Raza as a part of themselves, as a part of the community, but here as we are waiting for her body to come. I just want to say that her family and friends are proud of her, as a person, as an athlete she was. She is a martyr now,” said Sumaiya Mushtaq, the friend of footballer Shahida Raza who perished in the Italy migrant boat wreck last month.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2012 South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Championship semi-finalist's body is still somewhere in Rome, and her family and friends are waiting for further details as they restlessly spend their days in the hopes of some update. So far the Government of Pakistan has not notified where and how the body will be shifted. No details of the airline or ambulance are given.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this wait Shahida's family take respite from reality in praying for her as the house only reminds them of her not being there anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shahida, affectionately known as ‘Chintoo’ was a member of Pakistan’s women’s football team when the country made its international debut in 2010 at the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Women’s Championship. Even though football was not her primary sport, but she was talented and agile in the field that got her the place in the squad. She kept her spot in the team for the second edition too in 2012, making sure that her presence is felt. It was also the only time that the Pakistan women's football team reached a semi-final of any international event.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shahida perished among more than 70 people in a boat accident on the coast of Calabria on February 26.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, her teammates and people who played and coached her all remember her to be an exceptional player who was also massively unassuming.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shahida was a great player. I became friends with her through hockey. It was the most amazing quality of hers to make everyone feel good and at ease. I think her mark on everyone was that she was always smiling, even at times when she had problems at home. She would play the game with so much focus and passion, but in the background, on some days she would have had such a tough time to even get to the ground because she didn’t have money to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that was Shahida, filled with passion for the sports. She played because she loved to play, whether it was hockey or football. She never played for appreciation or to show others, she was self-driven, and she motivated others too.\n",
      "\n",
      "“However, if we look closely the sports she played did not give her back as much,” said Sumaiyya, who is staying with Shahida’s family, mourning and grieving for her sister-like friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shahida’s younger sister Sadia said that the family is dealing with the tragedy through prayers only.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would have been our seventh anniversary as friends a few days ago,” said Sumaiyya as she, along with Shahida’s family are waiting for the body to come home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are all restless. She is not with us anymore, but her body is there. I want to tell the Pakistan government to make this quick. This is the worst of the miseries. We were told last week that it will take 72 hours, but those hours have been over on Monday. It is not just those 77 people who drowned and perished in the sea, it is the 77 families who died with them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The boat was carrying people from different nationalities including around 24 Pakistanis who were trying to reach the European country with the prospect of a better future.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is still overwhelming that a hugely talented, seasoned, and well-established athlete, who represented Pakistan internationally in two disciplines, including the national sport of Pakistan hockey, was among the ones who were on the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shahida’s step was an extreme one that highlights the way athletes in Pakistan are not valued, how the economy is breaking the back of even the people with the strongest of characters, and how opportunities do not come to the most vulnerable people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shahida was an active athlete for more than a decade. She was just 29 years old and her decision to leave the country was mainly led by her love for her child Hassan, who is a three-year-old toddler with a disability. One side of his body was paralysed since he was an infant after 50% brain damage. Sumaiya said that Shahida was paid just enough that she could arrange for Hassan’s physiotherapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was fascinating to see Shahida come back to the sport. She had given birth twice and her first-born didn’t survive, so that was such a heartache for her. Then her son was born and he also fell ill, so keeping him healthy and looking for ways to get him on his two feet became the purpose of her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She always knew sports and she loved sports, therefore she made a comeback, and we were all stunned of course. A part of me was intimidated by her comeback because I played for another team and we were often opponents, and she was a formidable player in the mid-defence. It was a great rivalry too. The point is she made her comeback after a few years gap, but she was very impressive,” said Sumaiya, adding that the last hockey tournament Shahida played was in 2017 in Punjab.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Quetta’s Marriabad locality, where the Hazara community is settled, the air is filled with pain and grief.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Sumaiya adds that while there are moments of paralyzing bereavement in the day, like when having food and realising the mug was Shahida’s that is right in front of her, with memories of the beaming athlete everywhere around her house, talking about her achievements on and off the field helps.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She was all about making sure that her training and game is good like we would often say in her thick Urdu accent usually of people from the Hazara community, “Choro ye log apna kerte hain, hum apna kerenge [Leave them we’ll improve our game], when it comes to seeing men’s hockey or even other athletes because she always believed in being original. She never blindly followed anyone. She was a person of her own,” said Sumaiya.\n",
      "\n",
      "She recalled that Shahida liked legends like Sohail Abbas and in football the usual popular players but mostly she held her local stars at the Hazara Quetta Football Academy in high regard and was very appreciative of the game from anyone who excelled in the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, her football coach Abbas said that Shahida was extraordinarily talented in the midfield wearing the number 5 jersey in hockey, and he has seen her grow up with hockey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She made sure that she played for the players in the team, she was never selfish about the game. The funniest thing about Shahida was we often wondered how old she is. She never looked her age. We often joked that she could even play for the teenage tournaments,” said Abbas, adding that everyone in his academy in Quetta has been grieving and praying for Shahida since the news broke.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the Pakistan Hockey Federation that sent the press release about Shahida’s passing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Abbas, her football coach who took her to the Saff Championship Tariq Lutfi also iterated Shahida’s ability to look young and energetic on the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shahida was a very talented girl. She brought great skill and knowledge unlike many other footballers because she was coming with a background in hockey. I was very impressed with her agility and her understanding of the game. It was very instinctive and natural,” said Lutfi, who coached her in the national championship-winning campaigns as well as with Balochistan United.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is just sad that Shahida has become the third footballer among women who have passed away in an accident like this. Earlier it was Misha Dawood who passed away in the Air Blue plane crash, then our Pakistan international striker Shahlyla Baloch was lost to a car accident and now Shahida. I don’t know what to say this, but pray for their souls and everyone’s safety.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shahida was brought into football and taken care of by the then Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) women’s wing chairperson RubinaIrfan. Shahida was brought on board in football as Rubina wanted to create a team from Balochistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pakistan national women’s football team played their last international tournament before 2022 in 2014, while Rubina’s youngest daughter and Pakistan’s star striker Shahlyla passed away in 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shahida played football with us from 2010 to 2016. We played on the national side and Balochistan United. After football stopped and Shahlyla passed, Balochistan United was unable to pick up. Chintoo moved back to her first sport which was hockey. She became the captain of the Army team and then the national team,” remembered Hajra Khan, Pakistan’s former women’s football team captain and key striker.\n",
      "\n",
      "She added that Shahida will always be remembered as a “bright firecracker on and off the field”, while the Quetta-born has also helped Hajra score her first international goal as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "International karateka Kulsoom Hazara recalled Shahida as a friendly athlete who was well-liked by all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doors were closing on Shahida\n",
      "\n",
      "Shahida was an exceptional talent. She was athletically inclined since she was young. Her hockey coach said that she came to play in the Balochistan hockey academy when she was in her teens, and she kept her passion for sports which later became a career as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Sumaiya said that towards the last years of her life, the departmental side treated her badly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shahida played for the best teams. She represented Balochistan on several occasions and won tournaments. She was a hot commodity before she got married. She played for Wapda and Railways and then with Army in hockey,” said Sumaiya. “Her name had come up in Army among the players who were nominated to be fired and that is when her breakdown began. It was last year. She was so upset. She was heartbroken, and it worried her to the end because she was the only breadwinner for her family. Her mother, sisters, and most importantly her son received the treatment because of her job.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then she got fired out of punishment because she had gone to help and play football with Hazara Quetta Football Academy in 2021, when there was the National Women’s Football Championship taking place in Karachi.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She said that Shahida thought it was fair to play football for her club where she played the game, while with Army she played hockey. So there was no clash, and she should have been allowed to stand for her football club.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had told her, she was such a big name, yet she was in Karachi, going for the National Football Championship supporting her club in niqab (face veil). Nobody knew who she was except for the team, and she said ‘Summi there is my community too, I have to abide by the culture and norms, I’ll do the hijab, I represent them’, but Army punished her. They would keep her on the bench, wouldn’t let her play. It was a very difficult thing for her, but she endured it, and then they fired her,” explained Sumaiya.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hazara Quetta Football Academy coach Rajab Ali also corroborated the account. He said that Shahida was with the team, but the Army department stopped her from playing and made her stay out of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shahida was very well respected. We are all sad because of her demise. The younger players thought they had so much time to learn from her. She was our seasoned player and she guided the players selflessly,” said Ali.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sumaiya added that the 2021 Women’s Football Championship was an incredibly challenging thing for Shahida as she had left her young son at home, who was also getting admitted to the hospital at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She loved football and her community so much and she sacrificed for both a lot. At that time she could still leave Hassan with her mother and sisters, but she was so worried, yet she kept up with everything,” said Sumaiya.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after being let go by the Army, Shahida tried to apply to many places and Sumaiya recalled sending many emails for jobs, but all was to no avail.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shahida was not treated well when she was alive. Honestly, the things people said to her had hurt her. It is just that she never displayed her reaction because she was an optimist.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Like her son’s paternal side would not let her see her son. That broke her, even till an hour before she passed away on that boat, she was asking of her son. She was saying that she is missing him. She used to cry for him, she wanted a better future. Our last exchange was about her son. She travelled to Turkey legally, but when she was going to Italy, she had said that they have heard about the waters being dangerous,” said Sumaiya.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once her body comes here I want to take legal steps really because her son, Hassan has lost one person who loved him the most, and we all see Shahida in him. He is all that is left of her, so her mother and sisters they all are here. He has five, six mothers. I was her best friend, and often she would teach me how to take care of Hassan, I always did as she asked because I thought I’ll help, I never knew she would leave like this,” said Sumaiya.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottom line is that if the football and hockey federations had done their job of establishing proper professional leagues, if there were opportunities and fairness in sports, Shahida may not have been on that boat and taken an extreme step like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The truth is when federations need players, the players are always there, but when the players need their federations and departments, they are never given any response. No one cares about what happens to the athletes and this is a tragedy. It is true that if there were more opportunities and fairness in Pakistan for athletes, and especially women, then she would have been alive today,” said Sumaiya.\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked if she has any message she said,” Shahida always used to say that a player must be given the respect of players, but we can see that she never received that treatment while she was alive. She always was respectful to the sport, to the fellow athletes, to the federations too, but she used to say in Pakistan the athletes were never kept like they are valued. This was Shahida’s message too, ‘treat players like human beings’. Do not discard players leaving them to be taken care of by luck alone, everyone is not lucky or privileged.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sumaiya said that the Hazara community is appreciative of sports and Shahida received immense support from her community, but it is the national federations and departmental sides along with the lack of facilities and opportunities, and lack of professionalism that ruins the lives of the athletes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sumaiya once again requested everyone to pray for Shahida’s soul and asked the government to help in bringing her body back home so that the last rights can be performed.\n",

      "A French labour union said members working in the energy sector had on Thursday cut power to the building sites for the Olympic Village for the 2024 Paris Games, as well as the main Stade de France stadium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gas and electricity supplies were cut to the sites as well as data centres, said Sebastien Menesplier, secretary general of the hardline CGT union's energy branch, as unions step up actions to thwart the government's controversial pension reform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unions are keeping up actions to force the government to drop the plan, with transport and other public services disrupted in France for the third day in a row.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government under President Emmanuel Macron says raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 and stiffening the requirements for a full pension are essential to keep the system from sinking into deficit.\n",

      "Central bank Governor Jameel Ahmad said on Wednesday that staff-level agreement (SLA) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was “close to finalisation” but shied away from giving a date amid his forecast of a reduction in non-debt creating inflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The head of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) made a policy statement about the external sector outlook, inflation and economic growth during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance.\n",
      "\n",
      "His assessment painted a bleak external sector picture, indicating that the combined inflows, on account of exports and foreign remittances, will be $14 billion to $15 billion less than the budgetary estimates made by the federal government.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The SLA is close to finalisation and it is now a matter of time when it will be announced,” said the governor. The current account deficit (CAD) projection that he gave for this fiscal year, however, was still out of line with the IMF’s forecast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will be closing this fiscal year at a CAD of around $7 billion,” said Ahmad – a figure that is $1.2 billion less than the IMF’s forecast but in line with Finance Minister Ishaq Dar’s assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CAD quantum has a direct bearing on the external financing gap, which Pakistan sees at $5 billion but the IMF has projected at $7 billion, according to the finance minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reduction in the CAD is artificial and has been achieved by closing industries and inflicting damage on the people, said Senator Kamil Agha.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CAD has remained $3.8 billion during the first seven months of the current fiscal year – down by 68%. According to the SBP, the economy continues to depict signs of a policy-induced slowdown, mainly in response to monetary policy tightening and administrative measures to counter inflationary pressures and address external challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking a jibe at the governor, PTI Senator Mohsin Aziz said that the SBP governor should be given a certificate of honour for shattering the economy to reduce the CAD.\n",
      "\n",
      "The governor maintained that imports will be opened but only after the completion of the IMF’s 9th review of the country. He insisted, however, that the banks were ensuring the provision of dollars for essential imports, including medicines, edible oil and fuel imports.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The foreign debt-creating inflows will start picking up after the revival of the IMF programme,” said governor, highlighting that gross reserves have increased to $4.3 billion on the back of a Chinese loan injection – but is still below a one-month import cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakistan has attracted only $690 million in foreign direct investments (FDI) during the July-February FY23 period compared to $1.2 billion over the corresponding period last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outflows on account of debt repayments were $2.4 billion higher than the inflows during the July-January period. Going forward, these flows are expected to improve owing to assurances from friendly nations, it added.\n",

      "“A successful completion of the ongoing 9th EFF review of the IMF is critical,” according to the written statement submitted to the committee by the SBP.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The governor explained that compared to $31 billion last year, foreign remittances will fall from $28 billion to $29 billion in this fiscal year – a reduction of about $3 billion. The senators, however, declared that the reduction will be far higher when compared with this year’s projected increase of $33 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "To a question, the governor agreed that the difference in the official exchange rate and that in the grey markets also caused a reduction in remittances. He said, however, “the central bank has suggested the federal government revise remittance related fiscal incentives, including for Saudi Arabia, to reverse the downward trend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To another question, he said that exports may also remain in the range of $28 billion to $29 billion – almost $9 billion to $10 billion less than the official target set by the Ministry of Commerce at the time of the budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exports have fallen by 7.4% during the July-January period and the decline in exports was broad-based except for some high-value-added textile items, said the governor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation\n",
      "\n",
      "“Inflation will remain elevated during the next three months,” said the SBP governor, but hoped that the average inflation rate during the current fiscal year would remain around 26%.\n",
      "\n",
      "To a question about whether the SBP will reduce interest rates in the coming months, Ahmad said, “No comment can be made at this stage about the direction of the interest rate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A member of the committee said that another 2% increase in the interest rate was coming next month on the IMF’s demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, the central bank increased the interest rate by 3% to 20% – in a move to “keep inflation expectations anchored amid rising inflationary pressures and increasing political and economic uncertainty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "National CPI (CPI) inflation increased to 31.5% in February 2023, as inflationary pressures remained elevated across all sub-components – food, core and energy, according to the central bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The recent pressure on the exchange rate, and increase in taxes and duties in the Supplementary Finance Bill, have added to inflationary pressures,” stated the central bank.\n",

      "During recent negotiations, the IMF increased the FBR’s tax collection target to Rs7.64 trillion after the imposition of mini-budget. PHOTO: REUTERS\n",
      "\n",
      "Mian Muhammad Mansha, one of Pakistan’s richest persons, on Wednesday advised the government to tax the real estate sector and retailers, the two areas that have been given preferential treatment at the expense of industrialists and salaried class.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suggestion was made in the first meeting of a committee constituted months ago by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to find avenues for revenue mobilisation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mansha and Mohammad Ali Tabba, who were the only private-sector members of the high-profile committee, were of the view that the government should not put any more tax burden on sectors that were already heavily taxed, according to participants of the meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The huddle was presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar. Other members of the committee are Special Assistant to the PM (SAPM) on Finance Tariq Bajwa, SAPM on Revenue Tariq Pasha, Reforms and Revenue Mobilisation Commission Chairman Ashfaq Tola and Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Asim Ahmad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The committee asked private members, who featured among Pakistan’s richest persons, to give their recommendations in writing. They recommended to the government to increase the share of services in tax collection by taking provinces on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tabba was among those who met with Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir along with finance minister on Monday. However, the businessmen’s meeting with the army chief has not been taken in good spirits as it is tantamount to dragging the military into economic affairs and undermines the role of finance minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PML-N government has always had a soft corner for traders, who are considered its strong supporters. In the budget, the government imposed a fixed tax of Rs3,000 per month on retailers, which former finance minister Miftah Ismail withdrew last year while giving in to the pressure exerted by Maryum Nawaz Sharif.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government had got special powers in tax laws to collect due taxes from the traders. But it never exercised those powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coalition government again imposed Rs170 billion in taxes on people but did not touch the realty sector and traders, who are heavily under-taxed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The private committee members encouraged the government to tax real estate and ensure that the sector did business only through banking channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The powerful committee’s terms of reference clashes with the Reforms and Revenue Mobilisation Commission, which is already working on a plan to expand the extremely narrow tax base. The duplication of work was highlighted by a government member in the committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, the FBR has been struggling to expand tax base and is heavily focused on those who are already paying taxes. All its efforts to bring more people to the tax net have not proved fruitful yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "During recent negotiations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has increased the FBR’s tax collection target to Rs7.640 trillion after the imposition of mini-budget. Even if the target is met, tax-to-GDP ratio will remain low at 9%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite enforcing the mini-budget and steep currency devaluation, the FBR could not narrow tax shortfall that came in at Rs212 billion in the first eight months of current fiscal year. The shortfall was in relation to the old annual tax target of Rs7.470 trillion, which has now become irrelevant after the mini-budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a whole, sales tax has remained the weakest area for the FBR. The collection of sales tax amounted to Rs1.7 trillion in eight months (Jul-Feb) of FY23, Rs138 billion less than the target. In a major failure, the FBR was not able to reap the benefit of 28-30% inflation rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tax collection in Jul-Feb FY23 was higher by a mere Rs26 billion than last fiscal year’s receipts, putting a question mark over the performance and efficiency of the revenue board.\n",
      "\n",
      "The salaried class has been made to suffer due to the preferential treatment meted out to the retailers and real estate sector. Even the IMF has failed to bring the retailers to the tax net and was happy with measures like the increase in GST rate from 17% to 18%.\n",

      "\n",
      "Safdar argued that the PTI chief had to appear before courts in criminal cases and there were security issues. Turning down the request for“foolproof security”, Justice Sheikh sought replies from federal and provincial governments by March 13.\n",

      "Haider told the court that the government used rubber bullets and water cannons at the PTI rally on Wednesday. He alleged that the authorities mixed chemicals in the water that was used in those cannons.\n",

      "Haider also told the court that Imran was ready to appear in the court but his life was in danger. He reminded that there was an assassination attempt on the PTI chief in Wazirabad in November last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imran was receiving various messages that his life had been in danger, the lawyer said, adding that attempts were being made again to assassinate the PTI chief. He also pointed out that Imran had come to judicial complex, but another case was lodged again him.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the court remarked that Imran Khan was allowed to come to the courtroom. The lawyer said that 36 cases had been lodged against Imran, adding that a few more cases might be lodged by nightfall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge said that Imran was not summoned by the ATC rather he himself filed a bail application. The government’s lawyer said that Imran’s life was in danger but he wanted to lead political rallies. He said Imran should appear in court rather than leading rallies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, the court accepted the exemption request of Imran Khan and extended his interim bail and the hearing was adjourned until March 21.\n",

      "SC judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah in his additional note in a recent case noted that the CJP in his order, had written that the elections in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab was a matter of great public importance, convincing him to invoke suo motu jurisdiction.\n",

      "“But, in spite of [this] observation, the two senior-most Hon’ble Judges of this Court have not been made part of this Bench to hear and decide upon the matters of “great public importance”, for reasons not expressed in the order constituting the present Bench,” Justice Shah continued.\n",

      "“Our greatest strength as an apex judicial institution lies in the public confidence and public trust people of our country repose in us.

      "The cooperative housing society had challenged a verdict by the Islamabad High Court against its encroachment of land allocated for a state-owned college.\n",

      "However, a three-judge bench of the SC, led by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, upheld the IHC’s judgment and dismissed the plea of the cooperative housing society.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the proceedings, Justice Athar Minallah expressed his displeasure over linking the name of a housing society with a government department.\n",

      "\n",
      "The petitioner’s lawyer maintained that there was also a Supreme Court housing society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Aminud Din Khan interjected that it was Supreme Court Employees Cooperative Housing Society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Minallah remarked that in his opinion, the Supreme Court’s name should not be used in a housing society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pointing out that the SC should not indulge in a private business, he asked the lawyer why was the ministry’s name used in the housing society.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer replied that if the court decided the matter, the housing society’s name could be changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Masood noted that when the housing society’s name was not a matter of dispute in the IHC, how could the SC issue an order to change its name?\n",

The much-anticipated insight into the war ground of Targaeryns and Starks is likely to release in 2024 and will begin shooting shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the release date is far, the showrunners are revealing bits and pieces of the plot to keep viewers curious and waiting. From the cast to the release date to new dragons, here’s all that we know about House of the Dragon part 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five new dragons\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday, at an FYC screening of his hit series in Los Angeles, co-creator Ryan Condal revealed a small, but fiery, tease of what fans can expect from season two of Game of Thrones prequel. “You’re going to meet five new dragons,” Condal told The Hollywood Reporter adding that the upcoming season would start filming “very shortly” in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Staying true to its roots\n",
      "\n",
      "A new season does not mean a fictional world of its own – the directors have assured the publication that the second season will still be based on Fire & Blood by George RR Martin. House of the Dragon is set two centuries before the events of Game of Thrones, and follows House Targaryen as they descend into a civil war over who should inherit the throne after King Viserys I (Paddy Considine).\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Season 1 was setting the table for a very bloody feast to come,\" Condal exclaimed. \"I wanted everybody to understand who all of these characters were and the long history they had behind them — behind their fathers and their grandfathers — that led us to this point where they end up fighting a civil war against each other. I'm really interested in particularly Rhaenyra and Alicent's families, and seeing what happens now that we've flipped the chessboard over and spilled the pieces on the ground. How do all those react? That's the story that we tell in season 2 and beyond.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "No cast has been confirmed yet but Olivia Cooke (Alicent Hightower), Emma D’Arcy (Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen) and Matt Smith (Prince Daemon Targaryen) are all expected to reprise their roles, as are Fabien Frankel (Criston Cole), Eve Best (Rhaenys Targaryen), Steve Toussain (Corlys Velaryon), Rhys Ifans (Otto Hightower), and Sonoya Mizuno (Mysaria).\n",
      "\n",
      "We can also expect the actors who play the next generation of Targaryens, shared Condal. Adding that the younger versions of Rhaenyra and Alicent are not expected to return, he did not entirely rule out their future appearances. \"I don't know. Younger Rhaenyra and Alicent are not a part of the story that we're telling, yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Starks return\n",
      "\n",
      "While season one primarily focused on just three houses – the Targaryens, the Velaryons, and the Hightowers – season two will see more Westerosi families pulled into conflict and it includes the Starks, the family at the heart of Game of Thrones. In Fire & Blood, Cregan Stark, the current Lord of Winterfell, plays a major role.\n",
      "\n",
      "About Starks, Condal said, \"We will cast Cregan Stark at some point, but no comment otherwise.\"\n",

      "Model-turned-actor Imran Abbas was at the peak of his career in the 2000s and was seen in various roles in local telefilms and dramas. While the Tum Kon Piya star had worked in local dramas and international movies, his appearances in Pakistani feature films have been rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a recent episode of The Mirza Malik Show, Abbas was asked whether he plans to make a comeback to Pakistani films, to which he responded that the country still lacked \"quality scriptwriters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have seen you in numerous Bollywood movies, but not in a Pakistani film, why is that?\" questioned the co-host Shoaib Malik. Hearing this, Abbas immediately corrected him, \"I haven't starred in any Pakistani film 'recently'.\" He then continued, \"I do get many offers; almost 50% of the films you see being released in cinemas have their scripts in my drawer back home. However, I just feel like we have a long way to go in terms of quality scriptwriting in Pakistan—or perhaps I'm not capable enough to be part of these beautiful films.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking about his upcoming work, Abbas revealed he had been working on several foreign projects. \"None of my upcoming films are from Pakistan; one is from America, the other from India, while another is an Indian-Punjabi film. I'm most excited about the latter as it's for the Punjabi cinema, which is quite popular all around the world,\" he shared.\n",

      "\n",

      "The Amanat actor also appreciated the Punjabi language due to its \"rich\" and \"beautiful\" characteristics. \"This language has a rare quality that just touches your heart,\" he added.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When Malik requested Abbas to choose an actor that he would love to collaborate with in the future, he said, \"Well, I'm not that keen on watching television these days but Alia Bhatt is a fine actor. I'm from the time when Madhuri Dixit and Rani Mukerji were considered the divas of Bollywood, so I would still label her as a contemporary performer.\"\n",

      "Adieu Maj Gen Julian Peter!\n",
      "As he breathed his last at the Combined Military Hospital in Rawalpindi on 1st March this year, Major General Julian Peter HI(M) leaves behind a shining legacy of what the white colour represents in the Pakistani flag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakistan Army’s first Christian Major General Julian Peter attended St Mary’s Cambridge School on Murree Road in Rawalpindi and resided in Rawalpindi’s Gawalmandi. Many outside the military circles may not know that Maj Gen Julian Peter was an illustrious soldier who, as part of the gallant 4th Frontier Force Haidry Regiment, had played a major role in the defence of Hilli sector in erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). As the legend goes, the Hilli position was heavily shelled by the enemy’s divisional fire even before the formal declaration of war on November 22. The shelling continued sporadically throughout the night. This served as a buildup to a significant Indian assault in this sector. The enemy attacked Hilli, where D Company, led by Maj (later Maj Gen) Julian Peter was stationed, with a furious charge on the night between November 22 and 23. The enemy was superior to 4 FF in both troops and material, and had every strategic advantage. The right forward platoon of D Company was the target of the battalion assault. The platoon resisted the battalion attack with tenacity and was effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a new enemy battalion launched an even more determined second assault, which occurred within one hour of previous assault. With almost unstoppable power, the enemy hordes charged forward. The battleground was transformed into a mosaic of fallen enemy combatants. Even when separated and surrounded, D Company under Maj Julian Peter persisted in its resistance. The company lost one soldier after another while battling an adversary who had vast numerical advantage, but never gave up. During this battle, men under the command of Maj Julian Peter kept the aggressive spirit and even launched local counterattacks to push back the Indian forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having suffered injuries, Maj Julian Peter refused to be medically evacuated and kept commanding the company till the end of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "After repatriation to Pakistan, Julian Peter kept working hard. In April 1989, he advanced through the army levels and was given command of the 124 Brigade in the Sialkot Cantonment. He was the first Christian elevated to the position of Major General in April 1993 and was assigned the command of the 40 Strike Division under the crack 2 Corps of Pakistan Army.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having personally known Maj Gen Julian Peter, we found him to be down to earth, humble, extremely honest but a hard taskmaster. Under his able command, the 40 Division came of age and developed into an excellent fighting machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be appropriate to tell the story of Christian officers and men who have served with equal zeal in Pakistan Defence forces as Muslim officers and soldiers. Taking some excerpts from a piece in Dialogue Times published on 19 July 2020 seems appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first Christian martyr was Younus Qaiser Shaheed of 16th Punjab who sacrificed his life for his homeland on 3rd July 1948 on Kashmir border. On 6th January 1949, a Christian cadet, Novan Theodore Fazal Elahi, died in an air crash few days before his passing out and he was probably the first martyr of Pakistan Air Force.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1965 war, Wing Commander Mervyn Leslie Middlecoat became known as the “defender of Karachi” and was awarded Sitara-e-Jurat in that war. In 1971 war, he sacrificed his life for his homeland and was awarded Sitara-e-Jurat posthumously. He has the unique honour of being the only Shaheed of Pakistan Air Force who has been awarded Sitara-e-Jurat twice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Squadron Leader Peter Christy Shaheed was also martyred in 1971 war and was awarded Sitara-e-Jurat posthumously. He was also awarded Tamgha-i-Jurat in the 1965 war. In 1995, Flying Officer Edvin Felix Shaheed sacrificed his life during an air crash in Quetta.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other Christian officers and men who gave their lives for Pakistan include Javed Masih Shaheed, Murad Shaheed, Rafique Masih Shaheed, Naik RC James, Jawad Haroon Shaheed, Lt Daniel Utarid Shaheed, Asif Adeel Shaheed, Capt Michael Wilson Shaheed. Major Sarmus Rauf Shaheed Tamagha-e-Basalat, a patriotic officer of Pakistan Army, spent most of his service in the border area and he was also a ghazi of Kargil. He sacrificed his life on 13 September 2007 at Nawazkot in operation Al Mezan.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we offer our condolences and tribute to Gen Peter’s family, our Christian fraternity and Pakistan Army, we would end the article with some quotes from Indian sources as written by Brig Asif Haroon Raja, another son of 4th FF regiment:\n",
      "\n",
      "NK Doval in Times of India of 13 March 1972 wrote: “During the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War, almost all battalions of the Guards Brigade (Indian 202 Brigade) were committed to the fronts. But it was at Hilli in North Western Bangladesh, that it fought its most intrepid action. In this battle, its men were pitched against the 4th Frontier Force, the crack battalion of the Pakistan Army.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Maj KC Praval in his book, Indian Army after Independence, writes: “Hilli was amongst the hardest fought battles.” Maj Gen Rajendra Nath in his book says: “The battle of Hilli proved the futility of attacking well-fortified places.” Dr Mankekar in his book, Pakistan Cut to Size, writes at one place: “At Hilli, they held their ground with admirable tenacity. Battle of Hilli was the toughest of all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Surely, Maj Gen Julian Peter HI(M) belonged to our finest outfits like 4 FF, who despite heavy odds and under extremely challenging circumstances, kept the Pakistani flag high, and to their best of ability fought for the motherland. We would thank our Christian fraternity which has always risen to the occasion and offered its sons like General Julian Peter HI(M) and Group Captain Cecil Chaudhry SJ, SBt, to serve Pakistan.\n",

      "Judges and grudges\n",
      "The new item on the wishlist of Maryam Nawaz is that before holding the elections in Pakistan, the country must reverse her father’s disqualification that had stemmed from the Panama Papers revelations. It was a foreign firm Mossack Fonseca and journalists from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that had leaked secret information about the financial dealings of many powerful individuals around the world. That firm and those investigative journalists were not concerned with or stood to gain anything from the politics of Pakistan. Today, the PML-N one more time wants to get away with the consequences of their immoral and illegal actions. Today, they also want to ensure that Pakistan would continue to be a country where truth would have no value. Pakistan is like a blackhole of truth, where the truth enters never to be seen again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal judgements are written by justices, which future lawyers will read and learn from. They’re supposed to be written in light of the supreme law of the land: the constitution. In Pakistan, however, what is learnt is that justice is not about the law and the constitution of the land but rather about the politics of the land. Sadly, judges have to be parties’ favourites, parties have to be establishment’s favourites, and establishment must be American favourite. It doesn’t get any stranger than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judgments given must be reversed so as to allow the return of Nawaz Sharif from his luxurious self-imposed exile which, let’s not forget, he had requested for health reasons four years ago. Leaders usually put up a fight against the odds. Nawaz wants to remove the odds and ensure a situation where he wouldn’t have to fight. The daughter wants to create a situation where her father comes back without any fight. Yet, he’d claim to be fighting for the people of Pakistan. It’s the real land of opportunities where anything is possible. No wonder these elites want to come to Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakistani citizens want to escape to some other land in order to avoid the economic hardships. Their passports don’t have the credibility to allow for such an escape. Nawaz wants a passport to the Prime Minister House without the political and legal hardships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current regime has no other ambition other than to sanitise their crimes and keep their stolen wealth without much spillover from legal and political poking. They want to turn the judiciary into a system where legal decisions would be applicable in the present only. Tomorrow is another day with another legal reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Someone wisely said that when a clown moves into a palace, he doesn’t become a king. The palace becomes a circus. We should expect nothing less from the crooks who are in charge of Pakistan’s politics right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that none of this is about the governed. It’s all about those who govern. The media, the judiciary, the police, and the rest of the governmental and social machinery are there to serve the people; on paper. The story of Pakistan could be summed up in very few words: those who matter don’t mind and those who mind don’t matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people have never mattered here. And sadly, they’re the ones paying the highest price for the ego and greed driven aggressive fight that have defined Pakistan’s politics for a generation. They know they don’t matter. And they don’t even mind it anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, judgements would be reversed and replaced by designer judgements. Journalists and social media activists would be hired to create fake noise and manufacture fake opinions. All in the service of one man and his cunning daughter. And all of this is possible because Pakistan is the true land of possibilities. Just not for those that Orwell called the Unpeople but rather the elite criminals of this country.\n",

      "Violence is not an answer\n",
      "The assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, on 31 October 1984, led to a massacre of Sikhs — still remembered as one of the darkest chapters of history by Sikhs. Tracing the background of the anti-Sikh riots, in June the same year, Indian military invaded the Golden Temple and thousands of Sikhs were killed in what is called Operation Blue Star. Was the move meant to gain popularity in Hindu political circles to win votes or was it to crush the Sikh nationalism? Seeing the dynamics of conflict, violence has grown bigger with every coercive action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indira Gandhi’s assassination by her Sikh bodyguards prompted anti-Sikh sentiment. The outcome was a massacre of Sikhs, and attack on their religious sites. The worst approach was that the entire Sikh community was held responsible for the acts of Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh. Was it just to take revenge from thousands of Sikhs who were peaceful citizens of India and had no hand in the killing of PM Indira? This extremist approach has only ignited the divide. In the prevalent context, the Sikhs world over are gathering support for ‘Khalistan’ which is suggestive of the fact that the pain of Operation Blue Star is still alive, and the hate that started with the two bodyguards is now spread all across. In the words of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) Counsel General, “Khalistan is the only solution as successive Indian regimes from Indira Gandhi to Narendra Modi have committed the genocide of Sikhs with impunity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent ‘Khalistan Referendum’ was held at Melbourne Federation Square. The Referendum witnessed a large gathering of Sikhs. Slogans of Ban Kay Rehay Ga Khalistan (Khalistan will be formed at any cost), Khalistan Zindabad (Long Live Khalistan) and Hindutva Namanzoor (Hindutva Unacceptable) were voiced. The Indian government has objected to the Khalistan referendum in Melbourne and has equated it with extremism. Spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs Arindam Bagchi reacted by saying, “We strongly condemn such attacks by extremist elements. We urge the local authorities to investigate and punish the perpetrators. We have been repeatedly taking up with the Australian authorities our concerns about actions by such elements, including the proscribed terrorist organizations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Khalistan referendum has also been conducted in the UK, Switzerland, Italy and Canada. Referendum is the right to express support or opposition to a political issue. Khalistan referendum is a peaceful expression by the Sikh community which does not want to be subservient to Hindus in India. Sikhs’ call for ‘Khalistan’ in Indian Punjab is to live and prosper in a politically and socially secure country, and that is an absolute democratic vision. Why then is it so that Sikhs’ call for freedom is being opposed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, weakness is a curse; it invites aggression. The quest behind Khalistan referendum is a reaction to Hindu extremism. Sikhs being a minority could not respond to Indian military’s atrocities at that time but now they have unity and have the political will to defend themselves. Dr Jagjit Singh Chauhan’s vision that “no power on earth can suppress the Sikhs. They are a people with a destiny. There will always be a Sikh nation” is still alive today. Dr Chauhan was the leader of Khalistan Council in the UK and the former Finance Minister of Punjab. He was banned from traveling to India because of being pro-Khalistan. Another point that merits consideration in the quest for Khalistan is the Hindutva political construct. It seems that the minorities have accepted the mantra of Hindu India. The minorities should live independently, and Khalistan referendum is a step in that direction i.e. a peaceful liberation of Punjab from India.\n",

      "Afghan government’s pragmatism\n",
      "The writer is a retired major general and has an interest in International Relations and Political Sociology. He can be reached at [email protected] and tweets @20_Inam\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some consistent themes that this scribe has been emphasising in dealings with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) and their forced protégé, the TTP. After a quick reiteration, we would discuss the prevalent situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, complex issues like the present Pakistan-TTP impasse cannot be resolved through quick fixes, officials vying for medals and decision-makers competing for legacy. Such complicated crises have their own life and multiple entangling linkages. And these get resolved when the time is right, and the stakeholders are more pragmatic. We saw the disastrous consequences of Kabul Dialogue with TTP last year. Second, the negotiating team should have capable and savvy government and agencies’ interlocutors, with a pulse on the Afghan/Pashtun psyche, and ability to speak in idioms and proverbs. Pashto language proficiency alone is not enough. Afghan/Pashtun is a shrewd negotiator. Third, the consistency and continuation of this (negotiating) team at functional level is important, as the policymaking level changes with changes in the government. Policy consistency is critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, the ownership of the process should squarely rest with the political/civilian leadership, with LEAs and others like academics, media-persons and experts providing the needed input on required basis. Fifth, the Jirga strategy has pitfalls, as Government itself is the arbitration authority, and not an equal party to the conflict on a par with the militant/terrorist groups. This age-old truism is well ingrained in the tribal psyche. Sixth, the other side, aka TTP, should sue for peace under Pashtunwali’s nanawatee injunctions, and only then the state’s magnanimity and raham (mercy) be invoked, once the conditions are right. Seventh, the beseeching TTP cadre be categorised into Black, White and Grey to be treated differently by the state under riwaj (tradition), tribal codes, laws, and sharia…as applicable. There is nothing like blanket amnesty, as some crimes are too raw and unpardonable till vindicated and punished. The state must retain deterrence at all costs. Eighth, those with ‘Black’ legacy and baggage are eliminated and/or deported and ex-communicated locally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ninth, the force of riwaj and lar (way-fare) is stronger and enduring than the injunctions of sharia…and the IEA knows it. Tenth, the dialogue (if and when) is conducted at the correct level with militants represented by their top-most leadership, and state sending in ranking officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was heartening to see the Government of Pakistan (GoP) finally optimising its strengths in dealing with the TTP brigands and approaching the problem head-on and at the correct level.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are certain constants at work vis-à-vis IEA (repeatedly mentioned) that should also be understood. First, IEA would like to rid itself of this legacy issue as; a) TTP mars IEA relations with its only interlocutor, Pakistan; b) it hinders IEA from extending its writ over the entire Afghan territory, given the TTP enclave in eastern Afghanistan; c) the TTP force-in-being strengthens its host, the Khostwal Haqqanis’ present weightage, and hand in potential internecine intra-Afghan fighting ‘if and when’ (the West reportedly is actively encouraging splits and factionalism inside the IEA); d) Afghan logistics cannot traditionally host large expat groups on its soil especially if these are armed. The reported TTP combat strength is estimated at around 12,000, and up to 30,000 with families included.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above considered, GoP need to know that despite the brother-in-arms jihadi fraternity between the TTP and IEA, the above realities compel IEA to take a more pragmatic view of the environment. Hence the emphasis on dialogue facilitated by Sirajuddin Haqqani, apparently looking for a win-win outcome for IEA, TTP and Pakistan in that priority. However, it did not work due to TTP’s over-ask, and the IEA’s (read Haqqanis’) ambivalence. Second, IEA would be amenable to pressure from Pakistan, applied consistently with unison from all stakeholders, under the international approval and our military-diplomatic norms. Straight talk with coherence and resolve sinks in. That was the message conveyed to the IEA after the change in the military leadership in Pakistan, when Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, DG ISI Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum and other officials including foreign secretary and the special envoy on Afghanistan, Ambassador Sadiq visited Kabul on 22nd February this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was right to separately take the issue to Moulvi Haibatullah Akhundzada first, the spiritual leader of IEA and TTP, to muster his support against TTP’s anti-Pakistan violence. It was also appropriate for the Defence Minister to head the delegation. He was rightly a critic of Gen Bajwa and Lt Gen Faiz Hameed’s flawed policy in the past to bring back TTP in group, unarmed and in Swat etc first, without enough spade work. IEA authorities were presented with irrefutable evidence of TTP’s presence on Afghan soil with ‘precise location of its leadership’. IEA, during the February meeting, outlined its future strategy and actions undertaken against certain TTP groups. The salient aspects of the IEA strategy, reportedly, is to disarm the terrorist outfit, relocate them away from the border and ‘ostensibly’ disperse them. Pakistan was requested to bear the cost of this plan, like similar offer IEA made to China for East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM).\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a workable and pragmatic plan. The cost of relocating around 30,000 TTP rank and file vis-à-vis a few hundred ETIM cadre seems a major impediment. However, if the Plan in first phase, just covers the ‘Black and active’ TTP cadre, the cost could be managed. Secondly, the cost could also be adjusted in tariffs and barters. The second issue is verifiability of the proposal once in effect. Mechanisms could be evolved for the purpose, like electronic tagging and reporting at police stations etc. And if the IEA is just trying to deflect the pressure over TTP-led spike in attacks inside Pakistan, we would know it. Ostensibly, the pragmatists in the IEA are keen to redeem the situation by taking tangible steps, hence this plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as Pakistan is concerned, IBOs in coordination with IEA, selective cross-border hot pursuit and strikes without making silly noises are other options on the table, besides continuation of relentless elimination of TTP cadre inside Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "IEA-led peace parleys miserably failed and under the spirit of Pashto adage par me ka, no mer me ka (convince me and win the argument, then kill me)…Pakistan enjoys the moral authority against an enemy whose anti-humanity mask is off.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pragmatic IEA knows the Pakistani leverages. It is time to unleash them with political clarity and resolve.\n",

      "Counterterror talks\n",
      "Pakistan and the US are turning a new leaf in their counterterrorism collaboration. It is a good omen that both the countries are aware of the changing strategic realities, especially in the backdrop of Washington’s hurried withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the challenges that Taliban 2.0 non-inclusive government is facing at home and abroad. Moreover, the regrouping of terror outfits in the landlocked country has compelled the State Department to review its policy. The fact that Islamabad is eager to strike a new chord with the White House, and work on pivotal issues such as improving defence cooperation, preventing and countering violent extremism and terror-financing has set the ball rolling. The resolution is to prevent the region from slipping into anarchy and abject terrorism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two-day dialogue is a great beginning, as it confirms the ground realities of immense cooperation as Pakistan and Afghanistan see a new wave of terror attacks. This huddle of counterterrorism officials, incidentally, has come days after a US report categorically stated that the TTP is regrouping with other militant outfits in Pakistan, and is determined to overthrow the government in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province that borders Afghanistan. The intention of the TTP, and their likes, to establish their own brand of Shariah has come as an immediate security threat to the whole region. Thus, this dialogue and the outcome to cooperate by reviving the level of understanding that existed in the wake of 9/11 attacks is a befitting response to unscrupulous elements who are out to hamper trade and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surely, the path of intermingling won’t be that easy for both the states. The first required element is to buoy the trust factor between Pakistan and the US, and not to highlight controversial issues that go on to infringe the sovereignty factor. Access to the US in terms of land and airspace, in its endeavour to oversee the southwest Asian region, had already created ripples. This new understanding must be result-oriented and pro-security, rather than an agenda of hegemony.\n",

Maryam stressed the need for exemplary punishment for Faiz to ensure that no one would dare play any “unconstitutional role” in the future. The same day (on Wednesday), a senior journalist and anchorperson shared on social media the response of Gen Faiz to what Maryam Nawaz said. According to the journalist, former DG ISI in response to the allegations leveled by Maryam Nawaz has reminded through text messages to him that he was merely a major general in 2017-18 and asked if a major general, while following the military discipline, could topple an elected government on his own. General Faiz is reported to have added that in the army, the decisions are made by the Army Chief only. He also said that all the verdicts (against Sharifs) were given by the courts.\n",

      "\n",
      "The FIA spokesperson said the businessman was arrested by the agency’s anti-corruption circle in the federal capital. The agency said the suspect had paid a bribe for acquittal in the case registered against him under the fake degree scam in Islamabad’s Cybercrime Circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spokesperson added that the agency had started investigating Shaikh following his arrest. The judge, too, was nominated in the case against Shaikh, the FIA said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FIA, on February 15, 2023, summoned the Axact chief in connection with the bribe case. Shaikh, however, did not appear before the probe team. Memon had acquitted Shaikh, chief executive officer (CEO) of Axact, the company that made billions of dollars by selling fake degrees worldwide, and others in fake degrees scam on October 31, 2016. Later, the judge was sacked on February 15, 2018, by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) as he confessed before a departmental promotion committee that he had received the bribe for acquitting the accused.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IHC division bench in April 2018 had set aside the October 31, 2016 acquittal order passed by Memon.\n",

      "Thankfully, 2023 DW is not the biggest asteroid to hit earth. Twitter/@Piero_Scoli\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are millions of asteroids out there in our solar system, very few are known to even potentially hit the planet and impact our home. However, scientists have spotted one a while ago and they believe its impact could be huge. What happens if an asteroid hits earth? Well, it depends on a number of factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The asteroid is named 2023 DW and was discovered just last month on February 26, reported the European Space Agency. It has been added to the ESA's Risk List which is a compilation of all the space objects that can have some sort of impact on Earth. Currently, 2023 DW ranks number one on this Risk List.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, that does not mean catastrophic damage will necessarily happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the Torino Scale, which measures the level of unusual danger, 2023 DW ranks 1, which means it is not predicted to have any unusual level of danger — nothing we have not seen before. Researchers have hypothesised that it is 50 metres in diameter. For better understanding, it is around the size of an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Now how big is an Olympic size pool? That is for you to figure out. It could be larger than that, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not the biggest asteroid to hit earth, though. According to the Planetary Society, the biggest one was 65 million years ago and eliminated 70% of all life from the planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Current calculations show the chance of collision is extremely unlikely with no cause for public attention or public concern,\" that ranking categorisation states.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other 1,448 asteroids on the same Risk List have a scale ranking of zero making this one more dangerous and impactful.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a reassuring statement, ESA shared that \"the asteroid has a 1 in 607 chance of impacting Earth.\" It will impact the earth at least 20 years from now. According to the ESA, the asteroid could interestingly hit the planet on Valentine's Day in 2046. It can hit after that as well, between 2047 and 2051, but same date: Valentine's.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office, the risk of it colliding with or impacting earth is \"very small\".\n",
      "\n",
      "So, is there an asteroid headed for earth? Yes. But is it likely that it will impact us? Maybe not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Often when new objects are first discovered, it takes several weeks of data to reduce the uncertainties and adequately predict their orbits years into the future,\" the office tweeted. \"Orbit analysts will continue to monitor asteroid 2023 DW and update predictions as more data comes in.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "In a talk with a private news channel, she asked Justice (retd) Khosa to testify on Quran if talks about his extension as the chief justice were not in the air. Maryam, time and again, had blamed Justice Khosa for being part of a conspiracy against Nawaz Sharif.\n",

      "She said that had Nawaz Sharif agreed, Khosa would have been the chief justice, and Umar Ata Bandial would not have been in the seat today. She said there were even talks of increasing the retirement age of the Supreme Court judges which, she claimed, was aimed to benefit Justice Khosa.\n",

      "She said a delegation had conveyed Khosa’s message to Nawaz Sharif, who was in jail at that time, claiming that the PMLN supremo had refused to grant an extension. In 2017, former CJP Khosa headed an SC bench that had disqualified Nawaz Sharif in the Panama Papers case.\n",

      "\n",
      "“We have already satisfied the IMF and will continue doing it,” the minister said in a brief chat with journalists here after addressing a seminar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier, in his address at a seminar ‘Reviving Economic Stability through Strengthening of Public Financial Management’ organised by the Ministry of Finance, Dar said that a “dictator’s era could not complete any IMF programme as they ran away from implementing it.” He said: “The most effective government also ran away from the 8th and 9th reviews of the IMF programme. The one and only programme which was completed successfully by all 12 reviews was during the era from 2013 to 2016 under the PMLN-led government.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I and my team are totally committed to honouring all these sovereign commitments no matter who made those in accordance with the best of our abilities. The IMF programme took longer than I thought because I have dealt with all 12 reviews of the one and only completed programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We seem very close to the signing of the Staff Level Agreement in the next few days,” Dar added. He again invited all political parties for signing the Charter of Economy by shunning political differences aside.\n",

      "Dar claimed a shattered economy was handed over to the coalition government; however, it showed commitment and sincerity to the state by acting upon all the tough conditions made by the previous government with the IMF.\n",
      "\n",
      "He regretted that petty politics was still being played over Pakistan’s economy by spreading rumours about falling into default which, he said, was totally a nonsense attitude. He said the bad economic crisis which the coalition government inherited was even more deeper and complex than that in 2013 and 1990s but with utmost sincerity and prudent policies of the government, the country had come out of the quagmire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are now in a position to move forward with full confidence,” he said, adding that Pakistan has the resilience to meet the challenges as it had huge resources to cope with the problems, but the only thing that had been lacking was lack consistency in policies and mismanagement in the fiscal sector. The minister informed the audience that the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio improved from 73 per cent to 69 per cent in a few years, which meant that there was no need to worry about the debts of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said even the developed countries such as USA and UK had high debt-to-GDP ratios of over 100% and, therefore “We need not worry about”.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the country’s foreign exchange reserves got down due to the fact that the government had been only paying back the debts and not getting new debts for the last few months.\n",

      "The United States, meanwhile, encouraged Pakistan to continue working with the IMF to improve the economy and the business environment to unlock funds from the global lender. US State Department Spokesperson Ned Price, while talking to the media, said that the US was working with Pakistani partners and, in turn, it is working with international financial institutions, the IMF, to put itself on a sustainable growth path.\n",

      "“Ultimately, it is going to have to be decisions on the part of our Pakistani counterparts to unlock this IMF funding.

      "“They improve the competitiveness of partnering Pakistani firms, fuelling economic growth that increases employment and household incomes. We believe that by continuing down this path and continuing to make the necessary economic decisions, Pakistan can put itself on a path to sustainable growth,” Price said in response to a question. “When it comes to economic challenges, when it comes to security challenges, when it comes to political challenges, the United States is ready and able to continue to be a partner to the people of Pakistan,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Offering condolences to the recent lives lost in clashes in Pakistan, Price said that the US is aware of reports about clashes in Lahore, ahead of a planned rally by former prime minister Imran Khan and it encourages all to exhibit restraint. “We encourage all to exhibit restraints.

      "From left: Murtaza Ali shah, Shanaz Saddique, Riaz Hussain and Mohammad Imran.— Reporter\n",
      "\n",
      "LONDON: Geo TV and The News London reporter Murtaza Ali Shah has won a preliminary trial on meaning for defamation at the UK High Court against three senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) officials who launched a defamatory social media campaign against him in March 2020 in the UK during PTI government tenure in Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "High Court Judge Mrs Justice Steyn, DBE, sitting at the King’s Bench Division of the Royal Courts of Justice, ruled that the words used by PTI leaders Mohammad Imran, Shanaz Saddique and Riaz Hussain against Geo and The News London reporter Murtaza Ali Shah were defamatory at common law and meet the threshold of seriousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time of making the defamatory statements and running a smear campaign, the three held powerful positions in the PTI UK; Mohammad Imran was PTI North-West region’s President; Shanaz Saddique was General Secretary of PTI North-West region and Riaz Hussain was Additional General Secretary of PTI North-West region.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three PTI officials ran a smear campaign against Shah for his journalism, for his stance about the arrest and detention of Geo and Jang Editor-in-Chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on March 12, 2020 under the PTI government and Shah’s exclusive reporting exposing how Assets Recovery Unit (ARU) had targeted children of Justice Qazi Faez Isa using a detective agency in the UK – a fact acknowledged also by Imran Khan after he was ousted from power. Imran Khan has said recently that he regretted the fact that Justice Qazi Faez Isa was targeted under his government as a Presidential Reference was filed against the upright judge and media ran smear campaigns against the judge and his children, including hounding them in the UK.\n",
      "\n",
      "After conducting a trial of preliminary issues of meaning at the UK High Court, Mrs Justice Steyn, DBE, accepted the meanings of six publications advanced by Murtaza Ali Shah’s barrister, Jacob Dean, and ruled that in all six publications by the defendants, Shah was defamed at common law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Murtaza Ali Shah, who has previously won two defamation cases at the UK High Court, brought his case against the three PTI officials after they came together and began a campaign against him on March 30, 2020 by launching a petition against him on Change.org and then publishing at least five YouTube, Facebook and Twitter publications. The defamatory petition carrying false allegations and lies was sent to PTI ministers and leaders in the UK and Pakistan, seeking their support, on WhatsApp and through several WhatsApp groups with thousands of members.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Justice Steyn, DBE, ruled that whilst the defendants had made written submissions in reply to the meanings of the publications, they had not pleaded the meanings they contended. At the hearing, Ms Shanaz Saddique made representations on behalf of all the defendants but Mrs Justice Steyn DBE ruled that to a large extent the “submissions addressed matters such as what they had intended, what viewers/readers had in fact understood the publications to mean, and evidence of surrounding matters” -- all of which were “inadmissible”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Geo and The News journalist had relied on six publications for his claim against the three PTI officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first publication was a petition with Murtaza Ali Shah’s photograph at the top of the page. The court found that the words used in the petition meant that Shah had “been misusing his position as a journalist by reporting news which he knew to be false and making allegations which he knew to be baseless with the aim of misleading his audience and garnering attention.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Justice Steyn, DBE, ruled that “an allegation that a journalist has knowingly publish false or baseless reports strikes at the heart of their professionalism, and undoubtedly meets both the consensus requirement and the threshold of seriousness. The statement of opinion that he has been misusing his professional position for his own purposes also meets those requirements. These are serious allegations to make against a professional journalist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second publication, Imran Hussain published a video (with a link to the petition) alleging that Murtaza Ali Shah has consistently, over many years, engaged in reporting negative news about Pakistan which he knew to be false, including the reporting of distorted facts and shockingly baseless claims, with the aim of misleading his audience and garnering attention. In doing so, he alleged that Shah has misused his position as a journalist, in breach of the rules of the UK media watchdog Ofcom, and it is high time his false reporting is exposed and stopped, and action taken against his employers by the Government of Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Justice Steyn repeated that these were “serious allegations to make against a professional journalist. The seriousness is emphasised by the First Defendant’s call to action in terms of the petition, the need to report the claimant to Ofcom, and the suggestion that the government of Pakistan should take action against the Claimant’s employer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The third publication was a video by Imran Hussain in which, Mrs Justice Steyn, DBE, found that the meanings of the words were defamatory and meant that Murtaza Ali Shah had until very recently been reporting unfairly distorted facts and had issued a video report with other journalists criticising Imran Hussain, such report containing many lies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her judgment, Mrs Justice Steyn, DBE, stated that describing the behaviours of a journalist as “unfairly distorting facts, and secondly, lying repeatedly in a report, are contrary to common, shared values of our society… I consider that it meets the threshold of seriousness, given the serious allegation that a journalist has distorted facts in his reporting. I also consider that the allegation of joining with other journalists to lie repeatedly in a video report meets the threshold of seriousness. Accordingly, I conclude that both meanings are defamatory at common law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth and fifth publications were tweets by Ms Shanaz Saddique in which she alleged that Murtaza Ali Shah was a corrupt journalist. In her judgment, Mrs Justice Steyn, DBE, stated that “Ms Saddique submitted that her intention was simply to share the petition and support her colleague. The tweets of Mr Chaudhary and Mr Khwaja that she quote-tweeted are simply the opinions of others. She said that she did not say the claimant was a corrupt journalist, she merely shared the opinions expressed by others. Her submissions ignored the repetition rule and trespassed into giving inadmissible evidence.” Mrs Justice Steyn DBE ruled that it was “obviously defamatory at common law to describe a journalist as corrupt”.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the sixth publication, Riaz Hussain posted a video in which he spoke with a link to the petition. Mrs Justice Steyn, DBE, found that the meaning of the words spoken by Riaz Hussain were that Mr Shah was “corrupt and has been harming Pakistan by knowingly misleading people through his journalism” and “clearly defamatory at common law”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Shah was represented by Barrister Jacob Dean of 5RB Chambers, instructed by Stone White Solicitors, and the defendants represented themselves in person. The case will now proceed to trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "For determining the defamatory meaning, the judge relied on the historic case of Shakil-ur-Rahman v ARY Network Limited [2015] EWHC 2917 (QB). The judge observed: “I have sought to avoid an over-literal approach but, as Haddon-Cave J observed in Shakil-Ur-Rahman, I have necessarily had to approach the task of ascertaining the meaning of the videos through the filters of, first, a transcript of what was said orally, and secondly, a translation of that transcript. I did not have the benefit of gaining the immediate impression which the words spoken would have had on the hypothetical viewer of the videos, who would have understood Urdu.”\n",

      "Branding the business community as a mafia that played a role in the bringing down the PTI government is a new twist to the regime-change narrative.

Asad Majeed communicated the alleged US plan to Imran Khan’s government through a cipher.\n",

      "The PTI twisted the conspiracy narrative by saying that Asad sent the cipher to Gen Bajwa who took the PDM into confidence and then the PTI government was overturned.

      "Governance for local government: Part - II\n",
      "The fragmentation of development projects into small schemes catered to the narrow interests of the local communities without any sense of priority, linkages, or widespread coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally, the transfer of resources from urban to rural areas should be a welcome move but such a transfer in the absence of a district-wide plan without specifying the goals to be achieved and assessing the cost-benefit of the approved schemes can be counterproductive. Urban-rural integration did not recognize or cater to the needs of growing urbanization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hasnain concludes on the basis of his study that in order to keep his voters happy, the district nazim would have very little choice but to acquiesce to the pressures exerted by the union and tehsil Nazims to allocate resources equally. The difference between ‘equal’ and ‘equitable’ distribution of resources should be understood as it is at the crux of the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under an ‘equal’ distribution scheme there is no clear relationship between the needs of the community and the intended interventions. Rich and poor communities will receive the same amount irrespective of the intensity of their need. ‘Equitable’ distribution takes into account the differences in the initial endowments and conditions of the intended beneficiaries. Those who are poor, marginalized, live in remote or geographically disadvantaged areas and cannot earn decent incomes on their own should receive higher allocations than those who are better off. Public resources thus supplement the private incomes of the poor to help out of poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two innovative features of the 2001 system are worth mentioning. The reservation of one-third seats for women and others for peasants, workers, minorities, the marginalized classes of our society, was an extremely commendable step. Similarly, the integration of the rural and urban administrative units at the tehsil level would have allowed the rural areas to benefit equally from the larger envelope of pooled resources available to the Tehsil Council. Even if the underlying patron-client relationship persists, the scope for inclusion of clients who were traditionally denied access under a MNA/MPA centred system, will be much wider under a decentralized and devolved system.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, despite these flaws, empirical studies and surveys point to the net positive achievements of the local government system. The Social Audit Survey 2009-10 of 12,000 households drawn from 21 districts in all four provinces found that 56 per cent favoured the continuation of the local government system with high proportions in Punjab and Sindh. The level of satisfaction with the union councils was 33.8 per cent but the situation regarding support and social acceptability of women’s participation seemed to have improved. Sixty per cent of female union councilors were of the view that people in their constituencies were happy with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The satisfaction levels of households with various public services varied but by 2009-10 satisfaction with roads, sewerage and sanitation, garbage disposal, water supply, health and education had improved although in percentage terms only less than half of the households expressed satisfaction with the services. Public education, at 58 per cent, showed the highest level of satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Social Policy Development Centre (SPDC) carried out a survey of 12 districts in the four provinces and found that the rate of enhancement in literacy of the population and access to water supply and sanitation had perceptibly increased during the post-devolution period. However, there were no indications of any impact of devolution on health indicators. The process of devolution was beginning to contribute to a quicker improvement in enrolment at the primary level and literacy in Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a micro level, Cheema and Mohmand analyzed a dataset of 364 households in the rural tehsil of Jaranwala in Faisalabad District to gain some insights regarding the types of households which gain and lose through electoral decentralization and whether the change in the post-reform provision between different household types is equitable. The empirical results of their study showed that increased access to development funds and heightened mandates for union nazims have resulted in a significant increase in union level provisions within a short span of time. They further found that the increase in the post-reform provision in nazim villages is less elite-based as it encompasses small peasants, minority peasant biradaris, and non-agricultural castes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hasnain reports on the basis of a survey carried out in 2005 that over 60 per cent of the households stated that they would approach a union councilor or Nazim to resolve their problems in comparison to only 10 per cent who said they would approach members of the provincial or national assembly. This reflects the increase in accessibility of policymakers after devolution. A system in which bureaucrats control the development departments provides neither access nor accountability. Having a system of elected nazims and councilors who remain responsive to the needs of their citizens is better because these officials are liable to lose their offices if they do not fulfil their responsibilities and duties. The best one can do with a recalcitrant bureaucrat is to transfer him out of a particular district but that does not resolve the inherent problem of access to the poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheema, Khawaja and Qadir in their study found that three types of changes were brought about by the 2001 devolution. One, changes in the decision-making level of the service – from provincial bureaucrats to district level bureaucracy. Two, changes in the decision-maker’s accountability – from bureaucrats to elected representatives at the district level; and three, changes in the fiscal resources available to the service.\n",
      "\n",
      "The education department, primary healthcare and the management of district and tehsil hospitals experienced a change of the first type, where the decisions previously made by the provincial secretariat and the provincial cabinet were transferred to the district nazim and executive district officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The municipal services provided by the local government, the rural development department, and the public health engineering departments of the provincial government became the sole functional responsibility of the tehsil municipal administration. This was a fundamental change because the power to allocate resources, prioritize projects, and deliver results moved away from 48 provincial departments to 6000 units of local government whereas prior to devolution, the deconcentrated provincial bureaucracy at the district level was accountable to their non-elected provincial secretariat. The 2001 devolution made them accountable to the elected heads of districts and tehsil governments. Under the previous system, the de-facto head of the district administration was the district commissioner who would report to the non-elected commissioner while after devolution he reported to the elected district nazim (mayor).\n",
      "\n",
      "Their study also found that a ‘rule-based’ fiscal transfer system between the provinces and the local governments was established under the 2001 Devolution Plan. Approximately 40 per cent of the provincial consolidated fund was distributed among local governments with due weightage given to backwardness in order to ensure some form of equity across districts in the allocation of development funds. The other innovation was that these budgetary transfers did not lapse at the end of the year but continued to be retained by the relevant local governments, providing for flexibility and presumably some improvement in the efficiency of resource allocation.\n",

      "Why educating girls is a game changer\n",
      "This week we celebrate International Women’s Day, one of my favourite events of the year. It’s the chance to celebrate sisterhood, to encourage our men and boys in the fight for gender equality and to share a vision for a world where all women and girls, without exception, enjoy freedoms that enable them to live life to their full potential. It is also a great excuse to put a bit of vibrancy back into the office and colour ourselves and everything else purple!\n",
      "\n",
      "In my role as development director here at the British High Commission in Islamabad, someone asked me recently what one change I would make to advance development here in Pakistan. I had no hesitation – educate girls. All the evidence shows that ensuring girls receive 12 years of quality education is the single most effective move a country can make towards its future growth and prosperity. If this claim seems too specific to be believable, here is the causal chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, young women who have been educated to secondary level are more likely to delay the age at which they marry, delay their first pregnancy and plan the number of children they have. In Pakistan, the demographic odds are stacked against sustainable development, with the number of citizens set to double by 2050. You could say it is a race to slow population growth and give public service provision, land use, housing and job opportunities the chance to catch up. What can help? Get girls into school and enable them to complete their secondary schooling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, a child born to a mother who can read is 50 per cent more likely to live past the age of five, 50 per cent more likely to be immunized, and twice as likely to attend school. In Pakistan where the communicable disease burden and infant, child and maternal mortality rates are still stubbornly high, educating the mums of the future is a huge step towards healthier communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, research shows that educating a girl can dramatically increase her lifetime earnings: with just one additional year of secondary schooling, a girl’s future earnings can increase by as much as 20 per cent. Not only is this good for the individual and her family, but it also contributes to national economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakistan displays far lower rates of female participation in the labour force rates than would be expected for a country at its level of development, partly because of low rates of female education. This is a total waste of talent. The World Bank recently assessed that Pakistan could accrue GDP gains ranging between 5.0 and 23 per cent by closing the female employment gap relative to its peers. There is a direct line between educating girls and realizing Pakistan’s economic potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, if the first three reasons weren’t enough, educating girls also improves a country’s overall resilience to climate change. For every additional year of schooling a girl receives on average, her country’s resilience to climate disasters can be expected to improve by 3.2 points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Girls’ education is powerful because it tackles underlying inequalities that increase female climate vulnerability such as poverty, and also some of the contributing drivers like population growth and pressure on natural resources. For Pakistan, one of the top ten countries in the world most vulnerable to climate change, educating girls seems like a sensible part of any national climate resilience strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This week, #UKinPakistan is celebrating #10Years10 lessons as part of a Decade of Learning, a GBP900 million investment in education in Pakistan made by the British people, through the UK government. Huge achievements have been made through a strong UK-Pak partnership at the national and provincial levels, involving partners from government, the private sector and civil society.\n",
      "\n",
      "From 2015 to 2021, the UK-Pak partnership supported at least 4.5 million children to get a decent education, including 2.1 million girls. Across the country, in Punjab, the number of qualified teachers has increased by 50 per cent. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, enrolment in primary and secondary schools increased by 55 per cent between 2011 and 2018, with increases at the secondary level of over 70 per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some key lessons have been learnt from this decade of learning as well: the need to focus on good governance of education systems and critical reforms; the importance of broadening access to education for all including the marginalized children, working in partnership with non-state providers; the laser-like focus has to be maintained on supporting kids to learn while at school, through strong leaders, equipped teachers and quality assessment regimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The devastating floods of 2022, and the Covid pandemic have created a learning crisis for countless children in Pakistan, girls and boys alike. There are now estimated to be 27 million children out of school, which is over a third of the school age population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tragedy of the last three years is that many of these children will never return to school, never realize their full potential. This is particularly true for girls who are out of school and who face multiple barriers to their life chances because of their gender. Now more than ever, we must redouble our efforts for girls’ education – there is no better way to shore up Pakistan’s long-term development.\n",

      "Who’s afraid of protests?\n",
      "March 8 should have been a day for freedom of protest and freedom of assembly to not just be ‘allowed’ but be celebrated as women took to the streets to peacefully engage in raising a voice for their rights in keeping with International Women’s Day. Things, however, took a completely different – and in one case, an allegedly deadly – turn. The Punjab Home Department decided to impose Section 144 in Lahore, once the PTI’s election campaign rally was announced to also take place on the same day. What ensued is for all to see. Roads were blocked, PTI workers beaten up by the police, water cannons used to ‘disperse’ protesters, and overall a state of chaos in the city. The PTI has also said that one of its workers was killed allegedly at the hands of the Lahore police. It goes without saying that such a disproportionate response to a protest was not just unseemly but a throwback to our dark authoritarian past. Even one life lost at the hands of law enforcement is one too many, and a taint on any government that professes democratic credentials. The incident must be thoroughly investigated and brought to justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this could have been avoided had Section 144 not been imposed and PTI and other rallies allowed to carry on without hindrance. Article 16 of the constitution of Pakistan guarantees the right to freedom of assembly: “Every citizen shall have the right to assemble peacefully and without arms, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of public order.” Successive governments in the country, both civil and military, have had a less-than-stellar record when it comes to allowing protests to take place peacefully. Whether government workers or farmers, labourers or nurses, teachers or students – whichever government has been in power has favoured an iron hand over negotiation, not realizing that quashing a protest has never led to any kind of peace or reconciliation. Ironically, our governments have meekly allowed regressive protests to block roads and indulge in violence but have never accorded the same treatment to those that have gathered peacefully for political or socio-legal demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way Section 144 was imposed also raises questions about the caretaker setup in Punjab. If a political party is not allowed to campaign when the election schedule has been announced in the province it will naturally lead to doubts about the setup’s impartiality. Instead of passing the buck to just the police and administration, the caretaker government needs to take responsibility for Wednesday’s happenings and an impartial investigation needs to look into the matter. The violence was not limited to Lahore. We also saw how the Islamabad police beat up the participants of the Aurat March. While action has been taken against those officers who baton-charged the women protesters, and they have been suspended, the larger question still looms: if law enforcement itself targets the Aurat March, what hope is there for the safety of women who are already battling hate speech and unfounded attacks by a large section of society? In Lahore, due to Section 144, many participants of the march couldn’t even make it to the event because roads were blocked. And those that did – women, transgender persons, allies – were then faced with belligerent social media personnel or ‘YouTubers’. Whether it be the PTI or the Aurat March, why are government, law enforcement and self-styled gatekeepers of ‘honour’ so afraid of a people’s right to assemble and voice their demands? Even in a minimum democracy, the right to protest must be guaranteed both at the administrative and the private levels. Wednesday was not a good day for democracy.\n",

      "\n",
      "The incident involving Silicon Valley Bank, a bank created over four decades ago, is possibly going to be recorded as that time in history when it had to be rescued by another bank, otherwise, it could blow up into flames in a single day.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don't yet know who the \"white knight\" will be, but you can bet there are plenty of discussions going on right now about who will step in and buy Silicon Valley's most popular bank, an organisation whose shares are down by more than 80% from where they were at the start of yesterday in after-hours trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then how and why? Well, not because the bank is disintegrating from the inside. Instead, it badly mishandled some crucial messaging at the worst possible time.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happened to Silicon Valley Bank?\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is what happened: Due to increased interest rates, Silicon Valley Bank lost $1.8 billion when selling its investments in mortgage-backed securities and US bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that its clientele, which consists primarily of startups, has far less money available to park at a financial institution at the moment, the bank is likewise dealing with declining customer deposits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "It made the decision to raise a lot of money to protect its business because of its current situation. It was intended to sell $500 million in convertible preferred shares, $1.25 billion in ordinary stock to investors, and another $500 million in common stock to the private equity firm General Atlantic in a separate deal, Tech Crunch reported. The obvious intention was to give the impression that the bank was being cautious and gathering the funds to help stabilise itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It flopped, though, and who can be shocked considering that it announced these plans just as the cryptocurrency bank Silvergate announced it was ceasing operations.\n",

      "Someone at Silicon Valley Bank might have stopped to consider that this might not be the best time to shore up the balance sheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is clear that they didn't. Instead, they issued a confusing press release yesterday after the market closed, which was treated so poorly it was almost funny. Except that many entrepreneurs and venture firms are currently frantically trying to figure out what to do to rely on Silicon Valley Bank as a financial partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is definitely not funny to the estimated 6,500 workers of Silicon Valley Bank either or to its CEO Greg Becker, who had to hop on a Zoom call late this morning to reassure terrified clients that it was simply a quick news release.\n",
